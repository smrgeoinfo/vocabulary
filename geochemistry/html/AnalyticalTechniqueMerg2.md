containing cells or particles is suspended in a fluid and injected
into the flow cytometer instrument. The sample is focused to ideally
flow one cell at a time through a laser beam, where the light
scattered is characteristic to the cells and their components. Cells
are often labeled with fluorescent markers so light is absorbed and
then emitted in a band of wavelengths. Tens of thousands of cells can

to a fine spot (with the typical spot size 0.05 -- 0.2 nm) which is
then scanned over the sample in a raster illumination system
constructed so that the sample is illuminated at each point with the
beam parallel to the optical axis.

- Child of:
 [`analyticalinstrument`](#analyticalinstrument)

- An instrument that measures the signal produced by nuclear magnetic
resonance of the atomic nuclei in a sample when exposed to excitation
by radio waves. The electromagnetic waves emitted by the nuclei of the
sample as a result of perturbation by a weak oscillating magnetic
field are detected with sensitive radio receivers. Upon excitation of
the sample with a radio frequency (60--1000 MHz) pulse, a nuclear
magnetic resonance response - a free induction decay (FID) - is
obtained. It is a very weak signal, and requires sensitive radio
receivers to pick up. A Fourier transform is carried out to extract
the frequency-domain spectrum from the raw time-domain FID.

[]{#confocallaserscanningmicroscope}

#####  Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope


- Child of:
 [`microscope`](#microscope)

- optical imaging instrument that increases  optical resolution and
contrast by means of a spatial pinhole to block out-of-focus light in
image formation. Capturing multiple two-dimensional images at
different depths in a sample enables the reconstruction of three-
dimensional structures (a process known as optical sectioning) within
an object. A confocal microscope focuses a small beam of light at one
narrow depth level at a time to achieve a controlled and highly
limited depth of field.  The point illumination and a pinhole in an
optically conjugate plane in front of the detector eliminate out-of-
focus signal - the name 'confocal' stems from this configuration. As
only light from  very close to the focal plane can be detected, the
image's optical resolution, particularly in the sample depth
direction, is much better than that of wide-field microscopes. Much of
the light is blocked at the pinhole resulting in decreased signal
intensity, so long exposures are often required. To offset this drop
in signal after the pinhole, the light intensity is detected by a
sensitive detector, usually a photomultiplier tube (PMT) or avalanche
photodiode, transforming the light signal into an electrical one.  As
only one point in the sample is illuminated at a time, 2D or 3D
imaging requires scanning over a regular raster in the specimen.

[]{#photometer}

###  Photometer


- Child of:
 [`analyticalinstrument`](#analyticalinstrument)

- an instrument that measures the strength of electromagnetic
radiation in the range from ultraviolet to infrared and including the
visible spectrum. Most photometers convert light into an electric
current using a photoresistor, photodiode, or photomultiplier.  To
analyze the light, the photometer may measure the light after it has
passed through a filter or through a monochromator for determination
at defined wavelengths or for analysis of the spectral distribution of
the light (see spectrophotometer, spectrometer).

REC-06-04-06)[Summary provided by CEMS].  Newly developed Time of
Flight instrumentation is augmenting more traditional quadruple and
magnetic sector based instrumentation. Laser ablation, graphite
furnace, liquid and gas chromatographic interfacing has facilitated
the analysis of a significantly increased variety of sample types,

####  Single Crystal X-Ray Diffractometer


- Child of:
 [`xraydiffractometer`](#xraydiffractometer)

- Diffractometer designed to analyze the structure of a single
crystal. Single-crystal diffractometers use either 3- or 4-circle
goniometers. These circles refer to the four angles (2, 'chi', 'phi',
and 'omega') that define the relationship between the crystal lattice,
the incident ray and detector. Samples are mounted on thin glass
fibers which are attached to brass pins and mounted onto goniometer
heads. Adjustment of the X, Y and Z orthogonal directions allows
centering of the crystal within the X-ray beam. Modern single-crystal
diffractometers use CCD (charge-coupled device) technology to
transform the X-ray photons into an electrical signal which are then
sent to a computer for processing. (https://serc.carleton.edu/research

[]{#xraypowderdiffractometer}

####  X-Ray Powder Diffractometer


- Child of:
 [`xraydiffractometer`](#xraydiffractometer)

- X-ray diffractometer with the geometry configured such that the
sample rotates in the path of the collimated X-ray beam at an angle
theta while the X-ray detector is mounted on an arm to collect the
diffracted X-rays and rotates at an angle of 2*theta. The instrument
used to maintain the angle and rotate the sample is termed a
goniometer. For typical powder patterns, data is collected at 2theta
from ~5degree to 70degree, angles that are preset in the X-ray scan. (

###  Chromatography analysis


- Child of:

- a laboratory technique for the separation of a mixture into its
components. The mixture is dissolved in a fluid solvent (gas or
liquid) called the mobile phase, which carries it through a system (a
column, a capillary tube, a plate, or a sheet) on which a material
called the stationary phase is fixed. The different constituents of
the mixture travel at different apparent velocities in the mobile
fluid, causing them to separate. The separation is based on the
differential partitioning between the mobile and the stationary
phases. The purpose of chromatography analysis is to establish the
presence or measure the relative proportions of analytes in a mixture.
The result is a chromatogram

 [`massspectrometry`](#massspectrometry)

- technique used to separate, detect, identify, and quantify
components of a complex mixture. The solid sample is extracted in a
solvent to pull out soluble target compounds; this creates both a
solid residue and a liquid extract.  The extract can be subjected to
additional procedures, for cleanup or exposure to acid vapor to break
apart large molecules.  The final extracted solution is injected into
the LC, which separates compounds in the solution and then passes them
into the MS, where their mass spectra are measured. Each time point on
the chromatogram is linked to a mass spectrum from which the most
intense signals are fragmented at defined CID (colision induced
dissociation) energy.  The combination of retention time (i.e., how
long it takes for the compound to pass through the LC) and mass
spectrum allows for identification of the compounds when compared to
standards.  The LC-MS-MS converted data is in a unversal format of
data called mzML and used internationally in LC-MS-MS analytical
community of small molecules, peptides to proteins.  mzML is a
universal Mass spectrometry format. xml namespace

-  a flat/polished crystalline specimen is placed in the SEM chamber
at a highly tilted angle (~70degree from horizontal) towards the
diffraction camera, to increase the contrast in the resultant electron
backscatter diffraction pattern. The phosphor screen is located within
the specimen chamber of the SEM at an angle of approximately 90degree
to the pole piece and is coupled to a compact lens which focuses the
image from the phosphor screen onto the CCD camera. In this
configuration, some of the electrons which enter the sample
backscatter and may escape. As these electrons leave the sample, they
may exit at the Bragg condition related to the spacing of the periodic
atomic lattice planes of the crystalline structure and diffract. These
diffracted electrons can escape the material and some will collide and
excite the phosphor causing it to fluoresce.

fluorescence emission. Thus, using fluorescence microscopy, the
precise location of intracellular components labeled with specific
fluorophores can be monitored, as well as their associated diffusion
coefficients, transport characteristics, and interactions with other
biomolecules. In addition, the dramatic response in fluorescence to
localized environmental variables enables the investigation of pH,
viscosity, refractive index, ionic concentrations, membrane potential,
and solvent polarity in living cells and tissues. Fluorescence is the
property of some atoms and molecules to absorb light at a particular

materials. The dry sample is usually evacuated of all gas and cooled
to a temperature of 77K, the temperature of liquid nitrogen. At this
temperature inert gases such as nitrogen, argon and krypton will
physically adsorb on the surface of the sample. This adsorption
process can be considered to be a reversible condensation or layering
of molecules on the sample surface during which heat is evolved.

[]{#atomprobetomography}

####  Atom probe tomography


- Child of:
 [`other`](#other)

- To conduct an atom probe experiment a very sharp needle shaped
specimen is placed in an ultra high vacuum chamber. After introduction
into the vacuum system, the sample is reduced to cryogenic
temperatures (typically 20-100 K) and manipulated such that the
needle's point is aimed towards an ion detector. A high voltage is
applied to the specimen, and either a laser pulse is applied to the
specimen or a voltage pulse (typically 1-2 kV) with pulse repetition
rates in the hundreds of kilohertz range is applied to a counter
electrode. The application of the pulse to the sample allows for
individual atoms at the sample surface to be ejected as an ion from
the sample surface at a known time. Typically the pulse amplitude and
the high voltage on the specimen are computer controlled to encourage
only one atom to ionize at a time, but multiple ionizations are
possible. The delay between application of the pulse and detection of
the ion(s) at the detector allow for the computation of a mass-to-
charge ratio. The method is destructive in nature removing ions from a
sample surface in order to image and identify them, generating
magnifications sufficient to observe individual atoms as they are
removed from the sample surface. Through coupling of this
magnification method with time of flight mass spectrometry, ions
evaporated by application of electric pulses can have their mass-to-
charge ratio computed. Through successive evaporation of material,
layers of atoms are removed from a specimen, allowing for probing not
only of the surface, but also through the material itself.The
instrument allows the three-dimensional reconstruction of up to
billions of atoms from a sharp tip (corresponding to specimen volumes
of 10,000-10,000,000 nm3). (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_probe)

- [might be: ]The Model 510 Moisture Analyzer (E. I. du Pont de
Nemours & Co.) the sensing element is a quartz crystal coated with a
hygroscopic material. The resonant frequency of such a crystal depends
on the crystal mass (King, 1964). The mass (and, hence, resonant
frequency) changes with the adsorption of moisture. A typical
sensitivity factor is about 1 Hz per A thickness of added material.
Two crystals are alternately exposed to sample air and dry air. The
frequency difference between the two is indicated on the analyzer
scale in parts per million (ppm) water vapor by volume.

proton, which is why the Nuclear Microprobe is also sometimes called
the Scanning Proton Microprobe. However, other MeV light ions can
generate the same analytical signals as protons, and are preferred for
some of the analytical techniques described. The focused beam is
scanned over the sample surface, and the strength of the relevant
analytical signal is measured at each position in the scanned area to
generate an image of the sample. There are many different types of
interaction that can occur when an MeV ion is incident on a sample,
and each one forms the basis of an analytical technique: Particle-
Induced X-Ray Emission (PIXE), Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry
(RBS), Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA) -- nuclear reaction products
such as alpha particles, protons, neutrons, or gamma rays are emitted.

2) the difference between the electrical powers into a sample and a
reference material is measured (power compensation DSC). (Source:
IUPAC; https://doi.org/10.1515/pac-2012-0609).
- a technique in which the difference in the amount of heat required
to increase the temperature of a sample and reference is measured as a
function of temperature. Both the sample and reference are maintained
at nearly the same temperature throughout the experiment. Generally,
the temperature program for a DSC analysis is designed such that the
sample holder temperature increases linearly as a function of time.
The reference sample should have a well-defined heat capacity over the
range of temperatures to be scanned. By observing the difference in
heat flow between the sample and reference, differential scanning
calorimeters are able to measure the amount of heat absorbed or
released during phase transitions. DSC may also be used to observe
more subtle physical changes, such as glass transitions. It is widely
used in industrial settings as a quality control instrument due to its
applicability in evaluating sample purity and for studying polymer
curing.

topography. (C.Daniel Frisbie, in Encyclopedia of Physical Science and
Technology (Third Edition), 2003). This is a type of Scanning probe
microscopy (SPM), a branch of microscopy that forms images of surfaces
using a physical probe that scans the specimen
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_probe_microscopy). When the
tip is placed in contact with the sample, heat flows from the tip to
sample. As the probe is scanned, the amount of heat flow changes. By
monitoring the heat flow, one can create a thermal map of the sample,
revealing spatial variations in thermal conductivity in a sample.

- atomic mass spectrometric analysis involves: (1) atomization, (2)
conversion of a substantial fraction of the atoms formed in step 1 to
a stream of ions (usually singly charged positive ions), (3)
separating the ions formed in step 2 on the basis of their mass-to-
charge ratio (m/z), where m is the mass number of the ion and z is the
number of fundamental charges that it bears, and (4) counting the
number of ions of each type or measuring the ion current produced when
the ions formed from the sample strike a suitable transducer.  (Skoog,
Holler & Crouch, p. 253).  Molecular mass spectrometry is used to
determine the structures of inorganic, organic, and biological
molecules and the qualitative and quantitative composition of complex
mixtures; The appearance of mass spectra for a given molecular species
strongly depends on the method used for ion formation. That these
methods fall into three major categories: gas-phase sources,
desorption sources, and ambient desorption sources. (Skoog, Holler &

- Mass spectrometry technique. Components: 1) sample preparation:

analyzer: accelerator Mass spectrometer; 4) detector: not specified.
In this technique, the target element is first chemically separated
from the sample before it is placed in a sample holder in the AMS
instrument. The sample element is then bombarded by cesium ions to
sputter the analyte element from the sample as negative ions. The
analyte ions are then accelerated down a beam tube by a positive
potential difference of several million volts, passed through an
electron stripper to convert them to positive ions, and accelerated
back down the beam tube toward common potential where ion velocities
approach a few percent of the speed of light. Using a series of
magnetic and electrostatic mass filters, the ion beam containing all
isotopes of the analyte element is then separated into separate beams
containing the (usually unstable) isotope of interest and other
isotopes, and each of the isotopes is counted by a separate detector.

- Gas chromatography combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry
(GC/C/IRMS) is a highly specialised instrumental technique used to
ascertain the realative ratio of light stable isotopes of carbon
(13C/12C), hydrogen (2H/1H), nitrogen (15N/14N) or oxygen (18O/160) in
individual compounds separated from often complex mixtures of
components. the sample solution is injected into the GC inlet where it
is vaporized and swept onto a chromatographic column by the carrier
gas (usually helium). The sample flows through the column and the
compounds comprising the mixture of interest are separated by virtue
of their relative interaction with the coating of the column
(stationary phase) and the carrier gas (mobile phase). Carbon and
nitrogen compounds eluting from the chromatographic column then pass
through a combustion reactor (an alumina tube containing Cu, Ni and Pt
wires maintained at 940 C) where they are oxidatively combusted. This
is followed by a reduction reactor (an alumina tube containing three
Cu wires maintained at 600 C) to reduce any nitrogen oxides to
nitrogen. For hydrogen and oxygen a high temperature thermal
conversion reactor is required. Water is then removed in a water
separator by passing the gas stream through a tube constructed from a
water permeable nafion membrane. The sample is then introduced into
the ion source of the mass analyzer by an open split interface, and
particles with m/z ratios of interest are counted by detectors..

- technique used to separate, detect, identify, and quantify
components of a complex mixture. The solid sample is extracted in a
solvent to pull out soluble target compounds; this creates both a
solid residue and a liquid extract.  The extract can be subjected to
additional procedures, for cleanup or exposure to acid vapor to break
apart large molecules.  The final extracted solution is injected into
the LC, which separates compounds in the solution and then passes them
into the MS, where their mass spectra are measured. Each time point on
the chromatogram is linked to a mass spectrum from which the most
intense signals are fragmented at defined CID (colision induced
dissociation) energy.  The combination of retention time (i.e., how
long it takes for the compound to pass through the LC) and mass
spectrum allows for identification of the compounds when compared to
standards.  The LC-MS-MS converted data is in a unversal format of
data called mzML and used internationally in LC-MS-MS analytical
community of small molecules, peptides to proteins.  mzML is a

- secondary-ion mass analyzers are based on bombarding the surface of
the sample with a beam of 5- to 20-keV ions. The ion beam is formed in
an ion gun in which the gaseous atoms or molecules are ionized by an
electron-ionization source. The positive ions are then accelerated by
applying a high dc voltage. The impact of these primary ions causes
the surface layer of atoms of the sample to be stripped (sputtered)
off, largely as neutral atoms. A small fraction, however, forms as
positive (or negative) secondary ions that are drawn into a
spectrometer for mass analysis. In secondary-ion mass analyzers, which
serve for general surface analysis and for depth profiling, the
primary ion-beam diameter ranges from 0.3 to 5 mm. Double-focusing,
single-focusing, time-of-flight, and quadrupole spectrometers are used
for mass determination. Typical transducers for SIMS are electron
multipliers, Faraday cups, and imaging detectors. (Skoog, Holler &

- (SSMS) a general technique for multielement and isotope trace
analyses. In SSMS, the atomic constituents of a sample, housed in a
vacuum chamber, are converted by a high-voltage (~30 kV), radio-
frequency spark to gaseous ions for mass analysis.  The gaseous
positive ions formed in the spark plasma are drawn into the analyzer
by a dc voltage. Because a spark source produces ions with a wide
range of kinetic energies, double-focusing mass spectrometers are
required for mass analysis of the ions. When electron multipliers are
used with double-focusing instruments, the spectrum is scanned by
varying the magnetic field of the magnetic analyzer. The use of this
technique leveled off and then declined with the appearance of ICPMS
and some of the other mass spectrometric methods. SSMS is still
applied to samples that are not easily dissolved and analyzed by
plasma methods.  (Skoog, Holler, & Crouch). Mass spectrometry

 [`spectrometry`](#spectrometry)

- Measurement principle of spectroscopy to measure the precession of
magnetic moments placed in a magnetic induction based on absorption of
electromagnetic radiation of a specific frequency by an atomic
nucleus. Nuclei having a suitable magnetic moment include
<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>19</sup>F,
<sup>31</sup>P. The technique is used as a method of determining
structure of organic molecules, or as a mechanism for quantification.
(Source: IUPAC; https://iupac.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PAC-
REC-19-02-03.R2_PR191002MC.pdf). A spectroscopic technique that
observes the signal produced by nuclear magnetic resonance of the
atomic nuclei in a sample when exposed to excitation by radio waves.
The signal is related to local magnetic fields around atomic nuclei.
The intramolecular magnetic field around an atom in a molecule changes
the resonance frequency, thus giving access to details of the
electronic structure of a molecule and its individual functional
groups. The electromagnetic waves emitted by the nuclei of the sample
as a result of perturbation by a weak oscillating magnetic field are
detected with sensitive radio receivers. Upon excitation of the sample
with a radio frequency (60--1000 MHz) pulse, a nuclear magnetic
resonance response - a free induction decay (FID) - is obtained. It is
a very weak signal, and requires sensitive radio receivers to pick up.
A Fourier transform is carried out to extract the frequency-domain
spectrum from the raw time-domain FID. As the fields are unique or
highly characteristic to individual compounds NMR spectroscopy is the
definitive method to identify monomolecular organic compounds.

- Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an
atomic-level method to determine the chemical structure, 3D structure
and dynamics of solids and semi-solids. The nuclear spin interactions
and the effects of magnetic fields and radiofrequency pulses on
nuclear spins in solid-state NMR are the same as in liquid-state NMR
spectroscopy. However, because of the orientation dependence of the
nuclear spin interactions in the solid state, the majority of high-
resolution solid-state NMR spectra are measured under magic-angle
spinning (MAS), which has profound effects on the types of
radiofrequency pulse sequences required to extract structural and
dynamical information. (https://doi.org/10.1038/s43586-020-00002-1,

#####  Absorption spectrometry


- Child of:
 [`opticalspectrometry`](#opticalspectrometry)

- Atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) detects elements in either
liquid or solid samples through the application of characteristic
wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation from a light source.
Individual elements will absorb wavelengths differently, and these
absorbances are measured against standards.
(https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/industrial/spectroscopy-
elemental-isotope-analysis/spectroscopy-elemental-isotope-analysis-
learning-center/trace-elemental-analysis-tea-information/atomic-
absorption-aa-information.html). Atomic absorption spectroscopy is
based on absorption of light by free metallic ions. It requires
standards with known analyte content to establish the relation between
the measured absorbance and the analyte concentration and relies
therefore on the Beer-Lambert law. In order to analyze a sample for
its atomic constituents, it has to be atomized. The atomizers most
commonly used nowadays are flames and electrothermal (graphite tube)
atomizers. The atoms should then be irradiated by optical radiation,
and the radiation source could be an element-specific line radiation
source or a continuum radiation source. The radiation then passes
through a monochromator in order to separate the element-specific
radiation from any other radiation emitted by the radiation source,
which is finally measured by a detector.

#####  Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy


- Child of:
 [`opticalspectrometry`](#opticalspectrometry)

- analytical technique used to measure a wide range of elements in
materials such as metals, pottery and glass. Although it is a
destructive technique (unlike ED-XRF), the sample size needed is very
small (typically about 10 milligrams - i.e. one hundredth of a gram)
and its removal causes little damage. The sample is accurately weighed
and then dissolved, often using strong acids. The resulting solution
is sprayed into the flame of the instrument and atomized. Light of a
suitable wavelength for a particular element is shone through the
flame, and some of this light is absorbed by the atoms of the sample.
The amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of
the element in the solution, and hence in the original object.
Measurements are made separately for each element of interest in turn
to achieve a complete analysis of an object, and thus the technique is
relatively slow to use. However, it is very sensitive and it can
measure trace elements down to the part per million level, as well as
being able to measure elements present in minor and major amounts.

spectrum is a plot of the number of electrons detected at a specific

peaks. These peaks correspond to the electron configuration of the
electrons within the atoms, e.g., 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, etc. The number of

In this technique, the target element is first chemically separated

sputter the analyte element from the sample as negative ions. The
analyte ions are then accelerated down a beam tube by a positive
potential difference of several million volts, passed through an
electron stripper to convert them to positive ions, and accelerated
back down the beam tube toward common potential where ion velocities
approach a few percent of the speed of light. Using a series of
magnetic and electrostatic mass filters, the ion beam containing all
isotopes of the analyte element is then separated into separate beams
containing the (usually unstable) isotope of interest and other

(GC/C/IRMS) is a highly specialised instrumental technique used to
ascertain the realative ratio of light stable isotopes of carbon
(13C/12C), hydrogen (2H/1H), nitrogen (15N/14N) or oxygen (18O/160) in
individual compounds separated from often complex mixtures of
components. the sample solution is injected into the GC inlet where it
is vaporized and swept onto a chromatographic column by the carrier
gas (usually helium). The sample flows through the column and the
compounds comprising the mixture of interest are separated by virtue
of their relative interaction with the coating of the column
(stationary phase) and the carrier gas (mobile phase). Carbon and
nitrogen compounds eluting from the chromatographic column then pass
through a combustion reactor (an alumina tube containing Cu, Ni and Pt
wires maintained at 940 C) where they are oxidatively combusted. This
is followed by a reduction reactor (an alumina tube containing three
Cu wires maintained at 600 C) to reduce any nitrogen oxides to
nitrogen. For hydrogen and oxygen a high temperature thermal
conversion reactor is required. Water is then removed in a water
separator by passing the gas stream through a tube constructed from a
water permeable nafion membrane. The sample is then introduced into
the ion source of the mass analyzer by an open split interface, and
particles with m/z ratios of interest are counted by detectors..

 [`massspectrometry`](#massspectrometry)

- technique used to separate, detect, identify, and quantify
components of a complex mixture. The solid sample is extracted in a
solvent to pull out soluble target compounds; this creates both a
solid residue and a liquid extract.  The extract can be subjected to
additional procedures, for cleanup or exposure to acid vapor to break
apart large molecules.  The final extracted solution is injected into
the LC, which separates compounds in the solution and then passes them
into the MS, where their mass spectra are measured. Each time point on
the chromatogram is linked to a mass spectrum from which the most
intense signals are fragmented at defined CID (colision induced
dissociation) energy.  The combination of retention time (i.e., how
long it takes for the compound to pass through the LC) and mass
spectrum allows for identification of the compounds when compared to
standards.  The LC-MS-MS converted data is in a unversal format of
data called mzML and used internationally in LC-MS-MS analytical
community of small molecules, peptides to proteins.  mzML is a
universal Mass spectrometry format. xml namespace

######  Secondary ionization mass spectrometry


- Child of:
 [`massspectrometry`](#massspectrometry)

- secondary-ion mass analyzers are based on bombarding the surface of
the sample with a beam of 5- to 20-keV ions. The ion beam is formed in
an ion gun in which the gaseous atoms or molecules are ionized by an
electron-ionization source. The positive ions are then accelerated by
applying a high dc voltage. The impact of these primary ions causes
the surface layer of atoms of the sample to be stripped (sputtered)
off, largely as neutral atoms. A small fraction, however, forms as
positive (or negative) secondary ions that are drawn into a
spectrometer for mass analysis. In secondary-ion mass analyzers, which
serve for general surface analysis and for depth profiling, the
primary ion-beam diameter ranges from 0.3 to 5 mm. Double-focusing,
single-focusing, time-of-flight, and quadrupole spectrometers are used
for mass determination. Typical transducers for SIMS are electron
multipliers, Faraday cups, and imaging detectors. (Skoog, Holler &

- (SSMS) a general technique for multielement and isotope trace
analyses. In SSMS, the atomic constituents of a sample, housed in a
vacuum chamber, are converted by a high-voltage (~30 kV), radio-
frequency spark to gaseous ions for mass analysis.  The gaseous
positive ions formed in the spark plasma are drawn into the analyzer
by a dc voltage. Because a spark source produces ions with a wide
range of kinetic energies, double-focusing mass spectrometers are
required for mass analysis of the ions. When electron multipliers are
used with double-focusing instruments, the spectrum is scanned by
varying the magnetic field of the magnetic analyzer. The use of this
technique leveled off and then declined with the appearance of ICPMS
and some of the other mass spectrometric methods. SSMS is still
applied to samples that are not easily dissolved and analyzed by
plasma methods.  (Skoog, Holler, & Crouch). Mass spectrometry

- Child of:
 [`gammarayspectrometry`](#gammarayspectrometry)

- In its most common form a solid sample is exposed to a beam of gamma
radiation, and a detector measures the intensity of the beam
transmitted through the sample. The atoms in the source emitting the
gamma rays must be of the same isotope as the atoms in the sample
absorbing them. The source is accelerated through a range of
velocities using a linear motor to produce a Doppler effect and scan
the gamma ray energy through a given range. In the resulting spectra,
gamma ray intensity is plotted as a function of the source velocity.
At velocities corresponding to the resonant energy levels of the
sample, a fraction of the gamma rays are absorbed, resulting in a drop
in the measured intensity and a corresponding dip in the spectrum. The
number, positions, and intensities of the dips (also called peaks;
dips in transmitted intensity are peaks in absorbance) provide
information about the chemical environment of the absorbing nuclei and
can be used to characterize the sample.

- Child of:
 [`infraredspectrometry`](#infraredspectrometry)

- A technique used to obtain an infrared spectrum of absorption or
emission of a solid, liquid, or gas. Light from a polychromatic
infrared source is collimated and directed to a beam splitter. Half
the light is directed to a fixed mirror and the rest to a moving
mirror. The light from the two paths is recombined, resulting in
constructive or destructive interference that is a function of
wavelength in the polychromatic light source and the path retardation
determined by different path lengths from the moving mirror. The
recombined light is focused on the sample and reflected or transmitted
light is refocused onto a detector.  The difference in optical path
length between the two arms to the interferometer is known as the
retardation or optical path difference (OPD). An interferogram is
obtained by varying the retardation and recording the signal from the
detector for various values of the retardation. The interferogram when
no sample is present is used as a reference to compare. When a sample
is present the background interferogram is modulated by the presence
of absorption bands in the sample. The interferogram is converted to a
spectrum by Fourier transformation.

elemental-isotope-analysis/spectroscopy-elemental-isotope-analysis-
learning-center/trace-elemental-analysis-tea-information/atomic-
absorption-aa-information.html). Atomic absorption spectroscopy is
based on absorption of light by free metallic ions. It requires
standards with known analyte content to establish the relation between
the measured absorbance and the analyte concentration and relies
therefore on the Beer-Lambert law. In order to analyze a sample for
its atomic constituents, it has to be atomized. The atomizers most
commonly used nowadays are flames and electrothermal (graphite tube)
atomizers. The atoms should then be irradiated by optical radiation,
and the radiation source could be an element-specific line radiation
source or a continuum radiation source. The radiation then passes
through a monochromator in order to separate the element-specific
radiation from any other radiation emitted by the radiation source,
which is finally measured by a detector.

gas.  Infrared energy is emitted from a heated filament. By optically
filtering the energy, the radiation spectrum is limited to the
absorption band of the gas being measured. A detector measures the

######  Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy


- Child of:
 [`opticalspectrometry`](#opticalspectrometry)

- analytical technique used to measure a wide range of elements in
materials such as metals, pottery and glass. Although it is a
destructive technique (unlike ED-XRF), the sample size needed is very
small (typically about 10 milligrams - i.e. one hundredth of a gram)
and its removal causes little damage. The sample is accurately weighed
and then dissolved, often using strong acids. The resulting solution
is sprayed into the flame of the instrument and atomized. Light of a
suitable wavelength for a particular element is shone through the
flame, and some of this light is absorbed by the atoms of the sample.
The amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of
the element in the solution, and hence in the original object.
Measurements are made separately for each element of interest in turn
to achieve a complete analysis of an object, and thus the technique is
relatively slow to use. However, it is very sensitive and it can
measure trace elements down to the part per million level, as well as
being able to measure elements present in minor and major amounts.

######  X-ray absorption spectrometry


- Child of:
 [`xrayspectrometry`](#xrayspectrometry)

- In this technique, the sample is exposed to monochromatic x-rays for
which the photon energy is tuned to a range where core electrons can
be excited (0.1-100 keV). When the incident x-ray energy is larger
than the electron binding energy, there is a sharp increase in
absorption (an edge). The edge positions are related to the core
electron that is excited. Each element has its own edge energy, and an
elements valence can be measured even in a heterogeneous sample.
There are three main regions found on a spectrum generated by XAS data
which are treated as separate spectroscopic techniques: 1) absorption
threshold determined by the transition to the lowest unoccupied
states; 2) near-edge structure (XANES); 3) Extended X-ray absorption
fine structure (EXAFS) (at energy higher than the edge). X-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is used for determining the local
geometric and/or electronic structure of matter. The experiment is
usually performed at synchrotron radiation facilities, which provide
intense and tunable X-ray beams. Samples can be in the gas phase,
solutions, or solids.

#######  X-ray absorption near edge structure spectrometry


- Child of:
 [`xrayabsorptionspectrometry`](#xrayabsorptionspectrometry)

- This technique is based on the absorption of an x-ray photon, in
which an electron interacts with an incident x-ray to acquire a time
dependent acceleration. The electron may then be promoted from a core-
orbital to an unoccupied bound or continuum state with an intensity
given by Fermis Golden Rule. By varying the energy of a
monochromatized beam of incident photons, a spectrum of the absorption
cross section can be generated. The probability of an excitation
sharply increases when the energy of the incident photon reaches the
binding energy of a core-electron. In X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
(XAS) this is referred to as an edge. XANES is a subset of XAS in
which the local electronic structure is characterized by investigating
the absorption cross section within 50-100 eV of an edge. The XANES
region is sensitive to a wealth of electronic structure information,
which may be analyzed in three sections. Before the edge, the
intensity of pre-edge features is greatly affected by the coordination
geometry of the central atom. At the edge, formal oxidation state may
be qualitatively assigned, as the energy of the edge position is not
an invariant quantity for a given element, the position shifts in
accordance with electron density. Finally, coordination shells are
interrogated just beyond the edge as the emitted photoelectron
scatters off neighboring atoms.

- a surface elemental analysis technique often used for the ultra-
trace analysis of particles, residues, and impurities on smooth
surfaces. TXRF is essentially an energy dispersive XRF technique
arranged in a special geometry. An incident beam impinges upon a
polished flat sample carrier at angles below the critical angle of
external total reflection for X-rays, resulting in the reflection of
most of the excitation beam photons at this surface. Since Total
Reflection angle depends on the energy of the photon, one can use this
effect to eliminate the high energy photons from the excitation
spectrum and minimize their contribution to the background in the
measured spectra, thus making possible to achieve better detection
limits. Due to this configuration, the measured spectral background in
TXRF is less than in conventional XRF. This reduction results in
increased signal to noise ratio. (https://www-

content/uploads/2019/10/PAC-REC-19-02-03.R2_PR191002MC.pdf).  Raman
spectroscopy is commonly used in chemistry to provide a structural
fingerprint by which molecules can be identified. This technique uses
a source of monochromatic electromagnetic radiation to interact with
molecular vibrations, phonons or other excitations in the analyzed
sample resulting in the energy of the incident photons being shifted
up or down. The light source is typically a laser in the visible, near
infrared, or near ultraviolet range, although X-rays can also be used.
The shift in energy from the incident source gives information about
the vibrational modes in the analyzed sample.  Electromagnetic
radiation from the illuminated spot is collected with a lens and sent
through a monochromator. Elastic scattered radiation at the wavelength
corresponding to the incident excitation is filtered out, while the
rest of the collected light is dispersed onto a detector.

- Child of:
 [`thermalanalysis`](#thermalanalysis)

- Technique where either 1) the difference between heat flow rates
into a sample and a reference material is measured (heat-flow DSC) or
2) the difference between the electrical powers into a sample and a
reference material is measured (power compensation DSC). (Source:
IUPAC; https://doi.org/10.1515/pac-2012-0609).
- a technique in which the difference in the amount of heat required
to increase the temperature of a sample and reference is measured as a
function of temperature. Both the sample and reference are maintained
at nearly the same temperature throughout the experiment. Generally,
the temperature program for a DSC analysis is designed such that the
sample holder temperature increases linearly as a function of time.
The reference sample should have a well-defined heat capacity over the
range of temperatures to be scanned. By observing the difference in
heat flow between the sample and reference, differential scanning
calorimeters are able to measure the amount of heat absorbed or
released during phase transitions. DSC may also be used to observe
more subtle physical changes, such as glass transitions. It is widely
used in industrial settings as a quality control instrument due to its
applicability in evaluating sample purity and for studying polymer
curing.

- Child of:
 [`trackcounting`](#trackcounting)

- Like fission-track dating, alpha-recoil track (ART) dating is based
on the accumulation of nuclear particles that are released by natural
radioactivity and produce etchable tracks in solids. ARTs are formed
during the alpha-decay of uranium and thorium as well as of their
daughter nuclei. When emitting an alpha-particle, the heavy remaining
nucleus recoils 30-40 nm, leaving behind a trail of radiation damage.
Through etching the ART tracks become visible with interference phase-
contrast microscopy. Alpha-recoil dating has a great potential for
Quaternary chronometry and tephrochronology.

analysis measures the weight or concentration of a solid that has
either formed from a precipitate or dissolved in a liquid. (
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_chemistry#Gravimetric_analysis ).
Gravimeters can be regarded as special-purpose accelerometers.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravimetry). An accelerometer is a
damped mass, a proof mass, on a spring. When the accelerometer
experiences an acceleration, the mass is moved to the point that the
spring can push (accelerate) the mass at the same speed as the casing.
The measurement of the spring's compression measures the acceleration.

###  X-Ray Diffraction
* `X-ray diffraction`


- Child of:
 [`analyticalmethod`](#analyticalmethod)

- Measurement method using diffraction of X-radiation to obtain the
spatial arrangement of atoms in a crystalline sample. X-ray
diffraction is based on constructive interference of monochromatic
X-rays and a crystalline sample. These X-rays are generated by a
cathode ray tube, filtered to produce monochromatic radiation,
collimated to concentrate, and directed toward the sample. The
interaction of the incident rays with the sample produces constructive
interference (and a diffracted ray) when conditions satisfy Bragg's
Law (n*'lambda'=2d*sin(theta)). This law relates the wavelength of
electromagnetic radiation to the diffraction angle and the lattice
spacing in a crystalline sample. These diffracted X-rays are then
detected, processed and counted. By changing the geometry of the
incident rays, the sample, and the detector, all possible diffraction
directions of the lattice should be attained.(https://serc.carleton.ed
u/research_education/geochemsheets/techniques/XRD.html) Copper K-a
radiation (l = 0.15406 nm, E = 8.04 keV) is typically used for routine
XRD. (Source: IUPAC; https://doi.org/10.1515/pac-2019-0302)
- technique based on observing the scattered intensity of an X-ray

[]{#singlecrystalxraydiffraction}

####  Single Crystal X-Ray Diffraction


- Child of:
 [`xraydiffraction`](#xraydiffraction)

- Single-crystal X-ray Diffraction is a non-destructive analytical
technique which provides detailed information about the internal
lattice of crystalline substances, including unit cell dimensions,
bond-lengths, bond-angles, and details of site-ordering. X-ray
diffraction is based on constructive interference of monochromatic
X-rays and a crystalline sample. These X-rays are generated by a
cathode ray tube, filtered to produce monochromatic radiation,
collimated to concentrate, and directed toward the sample. The
interaction of the incident rays with the sample produces constructive
interference (and a diffracted ray) when conditions satisfy Bragg's
Law (n*'lambda'=2d*sin(theta)). This law relates the wavelength of
electromagnetic radiation to the diffraction angle and the lattice
spacing in a crystalline sample. These diffracted X-rays are then
detected, processed and counted. By changing the geometry of the
incident rays, the orientation of the centered crystal and the
detector, all possible diffraction directions of the lattice should be
attained. Single-crystal diffractometers use either 3- or 4-circle
goniometers. These circles refer to the four angles (2*theta, 'chi',
'phi', and 'omega') that define the relationship between the crystal
lattice, the incident ray and detector. Samples are mounted on thin
glass fibers which are attached to brass pins and mounted onto
goniometer heads. Adjustment of the X, Y and Z orthogonal directions
allows centering of the crystal within the X-ray beam. Single-crystal
X-ray diffraction is most commonly used for precise determination of a
unit cell, including cell dimensions and positions of atoms within the
lattice. (https://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/geochemsheets/t

- Child of:
 [`xraydiffraction`](#xraydiffraction)

- X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) is a rapid analytical technique
primarily used for phase identification of a crystalline material and
can provide information on unit cell dimensions. The analyzed material
is finely ground, homogenized, and average bulk composition is
determined. The geometry of an X-ray diffractometer is such that the
sample rotates in the path of the collimated X-ray beam at an angle
theta while the X-ray detector is mounted on an arm to collect the
diffracted X-rays and rotates at an angle of 2*theta. The instrument
used to maintain the angle and rotate the sample is termed a
goniometer. For typical powder patterns, data is collected at 2theta
from ~5degree to 70degree, angles that are preset in the X-ray scan.
X-ray powder diffraction is most widely used for the identification of
unknown crystalline materials (e.g. minerals, inorganic compounds). (h

[]{#chromatographyseparation}

####  Chromatography separation


- Child of:
 [`analyticalseparation`](#analyticalseparation)

- a laboratory technique for the separation of a mixture into its
components. The mixture is dissolved in a fluid solvent (gas or
liquid) called the mobile phase, which carries it through a system (a
column, a capillary tube, a plate, or a sheet) on which a material
called the stationary phase is fixed. The different constituents of
the mixture travel at different apparent velocities in the mobile
fluid, causing them to separate. The separation is based on the
differential partitioning between the mobile and the stationary
phases. Chromatography separation is preparative;  purpose is to
separate the components of a mixture for later use, and is thus a form
of purification.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography)
