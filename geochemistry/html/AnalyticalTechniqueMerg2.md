####  Nanoscale infrared spectrometer (nanoIR)


- Child of:
 [`atomicprobeinstrument`](#atomicprobeinstrument)

- a probe-based measurement tool that combines key elements of
infrared spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to enable the
acquisition of infrared spectra at spatial resolutions of 50-200
nanometers, well beyond the optical diffraction limit. The nanoIR
system uses a pulsed, tunable IR source to excite molecular absorption
in a sample. As the sample absorbs radiation, it heats up, leading to
rapid thermal expansion that excites resonant oscillations of the
cantilever which is detected using the standard AFM photodiode
measurement system. These induced oscillations decay in a
characteristic ringdown which can be analyzed via Fourier techniques
to extract the amplitudes and frequencies of the oscillations. Then,
measuring the amplitudes of the cantilever oscillation as a function
of the source wavelength, local absorption spectra are created. The IR
source can be tuned to a single wavelength to simultaneously map
surface topography, mechanical properties, and IR absorption in
selected absorption bands.

then scanned over the sample in a raster illumination system
constructed so that the sample is illuminated at each point with the
beam parallel to the optical axis.

- An instrument that measures the signal produced by nuclear magnetic
resonance of the atomic nuclei in a sample when exposed to excitation
by radio waves. The electromagnetic waves emitted by the nuclei of the
sample as a result of perturbation by a weak oscillating magnetic
field are detected with sensitive radio receivers. Upon excitation of
the sample with a radio frequency (60--1000 MHz) pulse, a nuclear
magnetic resonance response - a free induction decay (FID) - is
obtained. It is a very weak signal, and requires sensitive radio
receivers to pick up. A Fourier transform is carried out to extract
the frequency-domain spectrum from the raw time-domain FID.

[]{#confocallaserscanningmicroscope}

#####  Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope


- Child of:
 [`microscope`](#microscope)

- optical imaging instrument that increases  optical resolution and
contrast by means of a spatial pinhole to block out-of-focus light in
image formation. Capturing multiple two-dimensional images at
different depths in a sample enables the reconstruction of three-
dimensional structures (a process known as optical sectioning) within
an object. A confocal microscope focuses a small beam of light at one
narrow depth level at a time to achieve a controlled and highly
limited depth of field.  The point illumination and a pinhole in an
optically conjugate plane in front of the detector eliminate out-of-
focus signal - the name 'confocal' stems from this configuration. As
only light from  very close to the focal plane can be detected, the
image's optical resolution, particularly in the sample depth
direction, is much better than that of wide-field microscopes. Much of
the light is blocked at the pinhole resulting in decreased signal
intensity, so long exposures are often required. To offset this drop
in signal after the pinhole, the light intensity is detected by a
sensitive detector, usually a photomultiplier tube (PMT) or avalanche
photodiode, transforming the light signal into an electrical one.  As
only one point in the sample is illuminated at a time, 2D or 3D
imaging requires scanning over a regular raster in the specimen.

[]{#photometer}

###  Photometer


- Child of:
 [`analyticalinstrument`](#analyticalinstrument)

- an instrument that measures the strength of electromagnetic

current using a photoresistor, photodiode, or photomultiplier.  To
analyze the light, the photometer may measure the light after it has
passed through a filter or through a monochromator for determination
at defined wavelengths or for analysis of the spectral distribution of
the light (see spectrophotometer, spectrometer).
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometer) Photometers are usually
used to measure parameters at certain wavelengths

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry). The sample is
vaporized and ionized, and the ions are accelerated in an electric
field, and several different techniques are used to measure the
abundance of ions with different mass to charge ratios.  Some example
techniques for the mass differentiation include time-of-flight,
deflection using magnetic or electric fields (magnetic sector, dual
focusing), stability of ion trajectories in an oscillating electric
field (quadrupole), and cyclotron frequency of the ions in a fixed
magnetic field (ion cyclotron resonance).

[]{#fouriertransformioncyclotronresonancemassspectrometer}

#####  Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer


- Child of:
 [`massspectrometer`](#massspectrometer)

- mass spectrometer that analyzed ion mass/charge based on the
cyclotron frequency of the ions in a fixed magnetic field. The ions
are trapped in a magnetic field with electric trapping plates, where
they are excited at their resonant cyclotron frequencies by an
oscillating electric field. After the excitation field is removed, the
ions are rotating at their cyclotron frequency in phase (as a "packet"
of ions). These ions induce a charge (detected as an image current) on
a pair of electrodes as the packets of ions pass close to them. The
resulting signal is called a free induction decay (FID), transient or
interferogram that consists of a superposition of sine waves. The
useful signal is extracted from this data by performing a Fourier
transform to give a mass spectrum.

#####  Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer


- Child of:
 [`massspectrometer`](#massspectrometer)

- Mass spectrometry technique based on coupling a mass spectrometer
with an inductively coupled plasma as an ion source that both atomizes
samples into their constituent atoms and ionizes them to form atomic
cations. The technique is highly sensitive for a range of metals and
several non-metals, and provides information on isotopic
distributions. (Source: IUPAC; https://doi.org/10.1351/PAC-
REC-06-04-06)[Summary provided by CEMS].  Newly developed Time of
Flight instrumentation is augmenting more traditional quadruple and
magnetic sector based instrumentation. Laser ablation, graphite
furnace, liquid and gas chromatographic interfacing has facilitated
the analysis of a significantly increased variety of sample types,
enabling the determination of up to sixty elements in samples as small
as 10 micro-meters in diameter and improved the resolution and
detection limits of organo-metallic species analysis in such matrices
as foodstuffs, water, sediment and environmental samples. Additional

 [`inductivelycoupledplasmamassspectrometer`](#inductivelycoupledplasmamassspectrometer)

- The Multicollector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry
(MCICPMS) spectrometer is a double focusing instrument that provides
high precision and accurate isotope ratio determinations, coupled with
flexibility and ease of use. [Source: University of Alberta.].  Mass
spectrograph based on a double-focusing magnetic analyzer that
spatially disperses ions of different m/z values on to an array of
Faraday cup detectors, generally used with inductively coupled plasma
ion sources for isotopic composition measurements. (Source: IUPAC;

[]{#secondaryionmassspectrometer}

#####  Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer


- Child of:
 [`massspectrometer`](#massspectrometer)

- A mass spectrometer that includes and ion gun that generates a beam
of 5- to 20-keV ions used to bombard a sample surface, causing the
surface layer of atoms of the sample to be stripped (sputtered) off,
largely as neutral atoms. A small fraction, however, forms as positive
(or negative) secondary ions that are drawn into the mass analyzer
part of the system for analysis. The primary ion-beam diameter ranges
from 0.3 to 5 mm. Double-focusing, single-focusing, time-of-flight,
and quadrupole mass analyzers are used for mass determination. Typical
transducers for SIMS are electron multipliers, Faraday cups, and
imaging detectors. Used for general surface analysis and for depth
profiling (Skoog, Holler & Crouch, p. 549)

[]{#singlecrystalxraydiffractometer}

####  Single Crystal X-Ray Diffractometer


- Child of:
 [`xraydiffractometer`](#xraydiffractometer)

- Diffractometer designed to analyze the structure of a single
crystal. Single-crystal diffractometers use either 3- or 4-circle
goniometers. These circles refer to the four angles (2, 'chi', 'phi',
and 'omega') that define the relationship between the crystal lattice,
the incident ray and detector. Samples are mounted on thin glass
fibers which are attached to brass pins and mounted onto goniometer
heads. Adjustment of the X, Y and Z orthogonal directions allows
centering of the crystal within the X-ray beam. Modern single-crystal
diffractometers use CCD (charge-coupled device) technology to
transform the X-ray photons into an electrical signal which are then
sent to a computer for processing. (https://serc.carleton.edu/research

[]{#xraypowderdiffractometer}

####  X-Ray Powder Diffractometer


- Child of:
 [`xraydiffractometer`](#xraydiffractometer)

- X-ray diffractometer with the geometry configured such that the
sample rotates in the path of the collimated X-ray beam at an angle
theta while the X-ray detector is mounted on an arm to collect the
diffracted X-rays and rotates at an angle of 2*theta. The instrument
used to maintain the angle and rotate the sample is termed a
goniometer. For typical powder patterns, data is collected at 2theta
from ~5degree to 70degree, angles that are preset in the X-ray scan. (

###  Chromatography analysis


- Child of:

- a laboratory technique for the separation of a mixture into its
components. The mixture is dissolved in a fluid solvent (gas or
liquid) called the mobile phase, which carries it through a system (a
column, a capillary tube, a plate, or a sheet) on which a material
called the stationary phase is fixed. The different constituents of
the mixture travel at different apparent velocities in the mobile
fluid, causing them to separate. The separation is based on the
differential partitioning between the mobile and the stationary
phases. The purpose of chromatography analysis is to establish the
presence or measure the relative proportions of analytes in a mixture.
The result is a chromatogram

 [`massspectrometry`](#massspectrometry)

- technique used to separate, detect, identify, and quantify
components of a complex mixture. The solid sample is extracted in a
solvent to pull out soluble target compounds; this creates both a
solid residue and a liquid extract.  The extract can be subjected to
additional procedures, for cleanup or exposure to acid vapor to break
apart large molecules.  The final extracted solution is injected into
the LC, which separates compounds in the solution and then passes them
into the MS, where their mass spectra are measured. Each time point on
the chromatogram is linked to a mass spectrum from which the most
intense signals are fragmented at defined CID (colision induced
dissociation) energy.  The combination of retention time (i.e., how
long it takes for the compound to pass through the LC) and mass
spectrum allows for identification of the compounds when compared to
standards.  The LC-MS-MS converted data is in a unversal format of
data called mzML and used internationally in LC-MS-MS analytical
community of small molecules, peptides to proteins.  mzML is a
universal Mass spectrometry format. xml namespace

diffraction camera, to increase the contrast in the resultant electron
backscatter diffraction pattern. The phosphor screen is located within
the specimen chamber of the SEM at an angle of approximately 90degree
to the pole piece and is coupled to a compact lens which focuses the
image from the phosphor screen onto the CCD camera. In this
configuration, some of the electrons which enter the sample
backscatter and may escape. As these electrons leave the sample, they
may exit at the Bragg condition related to the spacing of the periodic
atomic lattice planes of the crystalline structure and diffract. These
diffracted electrons can escape the material and some will collide and
excite the phosphor causing it to fluoresce.

is controlled by another set of magnetic lens and apertures. Each set
of initially parallel rays is focused by the first lens Objective
(optics) to a certain point in the back focal plane of the first lens,
forming a spot. The location of these spots is related to the
interplanar distance in the sample. Other lenses below the sample can

[]{#atomprobetomography}

####  Atom probe tomography


- Child of:
 [`other`](#other)

- To conduct an atom probe experiment a very sharp needle shaped
specimen is placed in an ultra high vacuum chamber. After introduction
into the vacuum system, the sample is reduced to cryogenic
temperatures (typically 20-100 K) and manipulated such that the
needle's point is aimed towards an ion detector. A high voltage is
applied to the specimen, and either a laser pulse is applied to the
specimen or a voltage pulse (typically 1-2 kV) with pulse repetition
rates in the hundreds of kilohertz range is applied to a counter
electrode. The application of the pulse to the sample allows for
individual atoms at the sample surface to be ejected as an ion from
the sample surface at a known time. Typically the pulse amplitude and
the high voltage on the specimen are computer controlled to encourage
only one atom to ionize at a time, but multiple ionizations are
possible. The delay between application of the pulse and detection of
the ion(s) at the detector allow for the computation of a mass-to-
charge ratio. The method is destructive in nature removing ions from a
sample surface in order to image and identify them, generating
magnifications sufficient to observe individual atoms as they are
removed from the sample surface. Through coupling of this
magnification method with time of flight mass spectrometry, ions
evaporated by application of electric pulses can have their mass-to-
charge ratio computed. Through successive evaporation of material,
layers of atoms are removed from a specimen, allowing for probing not
only of the surface, but also through the material itself.The
instrument allows the three-dimensional reconstruction of up to

- [might be: ]The Model 510 Moisture Analyzer (E. I. du Pont de
Nemours & Co.) the sensing element is a quartz crystal coated with a
hygroscopic material. The resonant frequency of such a crystal depends
on the crystal mass (King, 1964). The mass (and, hence, resonant
frequency) changes with the adsorption of moisture. A typical
sensitivity factor is about 1 Hz per A thickness of added material.
Two crystals are alternately exposed to sample air and dry air. The
frequency difference between the two is indicated on the analyzer
scale in parts per million (ppm) water vapor by volume.

- method to determine the proportion of an area that is covered by

a polished slab. The basic method is to cover the area by a grid of
points. Then for each of these points, the underlying object is
identified. Then the estimate for the proportion of the area covered
by the type of object is based on the fraction of points assigned to
that object type. (

[]{#energyfilteredtransmissionelectronimaging}

######  Energy-filtered transmission electron imaging


- Child of:
 [`transmissionelectronimaging`](#transmissionelectronimaging)

- The principle is to illuminate a very thin specimen with a beam of
high energy electrons. Some of these electrons will interact with the
specimen and result in elastic or inelastic scattering. Inelastic
scattering results in both a loss of energy and a change in momentum,
which in the case of inner shell ionization, the energy loss is
characteristic of the element the electron interacted with. After the
electron energy loss spectrum forms in the energy filter, an
adjustable energy slit allows only electrons that have not lost energy
to pass through to form the image. This is known as zero-loss
filtering. The filtering prevents inelastically scattered electrons
from contributing to the image plus enhances contrast image and
resolution. In addition to zero-loss filtering, you can adjust the
system to select electrons that have lost a specific amount of energy
to obtain additional contrast effects and compositionally sensitive
images. (https://eels.info/about/techniques/eftem)

sample in a raster illumination system constructed so that the sample
is illuminated at each point with the beam parallel to the optical
axis.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy). In
TEM parallel electron beams are focused perpendicular to the sample
plane, in STEM the beam is focused at a large angle and is converged
into a focal point. The transmitted signal is collected as a function
of the beam location as it is rastered across the sample. There are
multiple detectors for STEM imaging: 1) BF (bright-field) detector:
small angles (0-10 mrad). These images are similar to the bright-field
images obtained using TEM; 2) ADF (annular dark-field ) detector:
larger angles (10-50 mrad); 3) HAADF (high-angle annular dark-field)

proton, which is why the Nuclear Microprobe is also sometimes called
the Scanning Proton Microprobe. However, other MeV light ions can
generate the same analytical signals as protons, and are preferred for
some of the analytical techniques described. The focused beam is
scanned over the sample surface, and the strength of the relevant
analytical signal is measured at each position in the scanned area to
generate an image of the sample. There are many different types of
interaction that can occur when an MeV ion is incident on a sample,
and each one forms the basis of an analytical technique: Particle-

- Technique where either  the difference between heat flow rates into

difference between the electrical powers into a sample and a reference
material is measured (power compensation DSC). (Source: IUPAC;
https://doi.org/10.1515/pac-2012-0609).   A technique in which the
difference in the amount of heat required to increase the temperature
of a sample and reference is measured as a function of temperature.
Both the sample and reference are maintained at nearly the same
temperature throughout the experiment. Generally, the temperature
program for a DSC analysis is designed such that the sample holder
temperature increases linearly as a function of time. The reference
sample should have a well-defined heat capacity over the range of
temperatures to be scanned. By observing the difference in heat flow
between the sample and reference, differential scanning calorimeters
are able to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released during
phase transitions. DSC may also be used to observe more subtle
physical changes, such as glass transitions. It is widely used in
industrial settings as a quality control instrument due to its
applicability in evaluating sample purity and for studying polymer
curing.

[]{#lockinthermography}

#####  Lock in thermography


- Child of:
 [`thermalanalysis`](#thermalanalysis)

- The principle of lock-in thermography is based on the application of
a periodic input energy wave (i.e. thermal emitter, ultrasound,
microwave, eddy current, flash or xenon lamp, halogen lamp, or laser)
to the surface of the object being examined and analyzing the
resulting local temperatures on the surface of the object using an
infrared camera. When the input energy wave penetrates the object's
surface, is it absorbed and phase shifted. When the input wave reaches
areas within the object where the thermophysical properties are not
homogeneous in relation to the surrounding material, (i.e. at
delaminations or inclusions), the input wave is partially reflected.
The reflected portion of the wave interferes with the incoming input
wave at the surface of the object, causing an interference pattern in
the local surface temperature, which oscillates at the same frequency
as the thermal wave. The internal structure of the object being
examined can then be derived by evaluating the phase shift of the
local surface temperatures in relation to the input energy wave. The
ability to derive internal thermophysical inconsistencies within the
object, however, requires that the input energy source be used at an
optimal frequency, which depends on both the thermophysical
characteristics of the object as well as its thickness.

is measured over time as the temperature changes. This measurement
provides information about physical phenomena, such as phase
transitions, absorption, adsorption and desorption; as well as
chemical phenomena including chemisorptions, thermal decomposition,
and solid-gas reactions (e.g., oxidation or reduction). The
thermogravimetric data collected from a thermal reaction is compiled
into a plot of mass or percentage of initial mass on the y axis versus

electromagnetic radiation of a specific frequency by an atomic
nucleus. Nuclei having a suitable magnetic moment include
<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>19</sup>F,
<sup>31</sup>P. The technique is used as a method of determining
structure of organic molecules, or as a mechanism for quantification.
(Source: IUPAC; https://iupac.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PAC-
REC-19-02-03.R2_PR191002MC.pdf). A spectroscopic technique that
observes the signal produced by nuclear magnetic resonance of the
atomic nuclei in a sample when exposed to excitation by radio waves.
The signal is related to local magnetic fields around atomic nuclei.
The intramolecular magnetic field around an atom in a molecule changes
the resonance frequency, thus giving access to details of the
electronic structure of a molecule and its individual functional
groups. The electromagnetic waves emitted by the nuclei of the sample
as a result of perturbation by a weak oscillating magnetic field are
detected with sensitive radio receivers. Upon excitation of the sample
with a radio frequency (60--1000 MHz) pulse, a nuclear magnetic
resonance response - a free induction decay (FID) - is obtained. It is
a very weak signal, and requires sensitive radio receivers to pick up.
A Fourier transform is carried out to extract the frequency-domain
spectrum from the raw time-domain FID. As the fields are unique or
highly characteristic to individual compounds NMR spectroscopy is the
definitive method to identify monomolecular organic compounds.

and dynamics of solids and semi-solids. The nuclear spin interactions
and the effects of magnetic fields and radiofrequency pulses on
nuclear spins in solid-state NMR are the same as in liquid-state NMR
spectroscopy. However, because of the orientation dependence of the
nuclear spin interactions in the solid state, the majority of high-
resolution solid-state NMR spectra are measured under magic-angle

radiofrequency pulse sequences required to extract structural and

in Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) arises from the fact that emitted
electrons usually have energies ranging from 50 eV to 3 keV and at
these values, electrons have a short mean free path in a solid. The
escape depth of electrons is therefore localized to within a few
nanometers of the target surface, giving AES an extreme sensitivity to

monochromatic X-radiation (Skoog, Holler, Crouch p540) resulting in
emission of electrons. The emitted electron energy spectra are
obtained and chemical states are inferred from the measurement of the
kinetic energy and the number of the ejected electrons. A typical XPS
spectrum is a plot of the number of electrons detected at a specific
binding energy. Each element produces a set of characteristic XPS
peaks. These peaks correspond to the electron configuration of the
electrons within the atoms, e.g., 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, etc. The number of
detected electrons in each peak is directly related to the amount of
element within the XPS sampling volume. XPS requires high vacuum
(residual gas pressure p ~ 10-6 Pa) or ultra-high vacuum (p < 10-7 Pa)
conditions.

instrument. The sample element is then bombarded by cesium ions to
sputter the analyte element from the sample as negative ions. The
analyte ions are then accelerated down a beam tube by a positive

electron stripper to convert them to positive ions, and accelerated
back down the beam tube toward common potential where ion velocities
approach a few percent of the speed of light. Using a series of

- Child of:
 [`orbitrapmassspectrometry`](#orbitrapmassspectrometry)

- technique in which sample ionization is achieved by a process in
which a spray of charged droplets is directed towards the sample. When
the spray impacts the sample, a thin layer of solvent is formed into
which the analytes may dissolve. As other primary droplets arrive at
the sample surface, they splash secondary microdroplets containing the
dissolved analytes from the solvent film. This mechanism causes
analyte-containing droplets to be generated in the open air, and then
delivered to the mass spectrometer through a heated extended
capillary. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3205348).
After the desorption process, ionization occurs via mechanisms that
are similar to those of electrospray ionization, in which a high
voltage is applied to a liquid to create an aerosol
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrospray_ionization).  Mass
analysis is done with an Orbitrap mass analyzer.

######  Secondary ionization mass spectrometry


- Child of:
 [`massspectrometry`](#massspectrometry)

- secondary-ion mass analyzers are based on bombarding the surface of
the sample with a beam of 5- to 20-keV ions. The ion beam is formed in
an ion gun in which the gaseous atoms or molecules are ionized by an
electron-ionization source. The positive ions are then accelerated by
applying a high dc voltage. The impact of these primary ions causes
the surface layer of atoms of the sample to be stripped (sputtered)
off, largely as neutral atoms. A small fraction, however, forms as
positive (or negative) secondary ions that are drawn into a
spectrometer for mass analysis. In secondary-ion mass analyzers, which
serve for general surface analysis and for depth profiling, the
primary ion-beam diameter ranges from 0.3 to 5 mm. Double-focusing,
single-focusing, time-of-flight, and quadrupole spectrometers are used
for mass determination. Typical transducers for SIMS are electron
multipliers, Faraday cups, and imaging detectors. (Skoog, Holler &
Crouch, p. 549) Measure method in which a focused beam of primary ions
produces secondary ions by sputtering from a solid surface. The

- (SSMS) a general technique for multielement and isotope trace
analyses. In SSMS, the atomic constituents of a sample, housed in a
vacuum chamber, are converted by a high-voltage (~30 kV), radio-
frequency spark to gaseous ions for mass analysis.  The gaseous
positive ions formed in the spark plasma are drawn into the analyzer
by a dc voltage. Because a spark source produces ions with a wide
range of kinetic energies, double-focusing mass spectrometers are
required for mass analysis of the ions. When electron multipliers are
used with double-focusing instruments, the spectrum is scanned by
varying the magnetic field of the magnetic analyzer. The use of this
technique leveled off and then declined with the appearance of ICPMS
and some of the other mass spectrometric methods. SSMS is still
applied to samples that are not easily dissolved and analyzed by
plasma methods.  (Skoog, Holler, & Crouch). Mass spectrometry

- Child of:
 [`gammarayspectrometry`](#gammarayspectrometry)

- In its most common form a solid sample is exposed to a beam of gamma
radiation, and a detector measures the intensity of the beam
transmitted through the sample. The atoms in the source emitting the
gamma rays must be of the same isotope as the atoms in the sample
absorbing them. The source is accelerated through a range of
velocities using a linear motor to produce a Doppler effect and scan
the gamma ray energy through a given range. In the resulting spectra,
gamma ray intensity is plotted as a function of the source velocity.
At velocities corresponding to the resonant energy levels of the
sample, a fraction of the gamma rays are absorbed, resulting in a drop
in the measured intensity and a corresponding dip in the spectrum. The
number, positions, and intensities of the dips (also called peaks;
dips in transmitted intensity are peaks in absorbance) provide
information about the chemical environment of the absorbing nuclei and
can be used to characterize the sample.

- Child of:
 [`infraredspectrometry`](#infraredspectrometry)

- A technique used to obtain an infrared spectrum of absorption or
emission of a solid, liquid, or gas. Light from a polychromatic
infrared source is collimated and directed to a beam splitter. Half
the light is directed to a fixed mirror and the rest to a moving
mirror. The light from the two paths is recombined, resulting in
constructive or destructive interference that is a function of
wavelength in the polychromatic light source and the path retardation
determined by different path lengths from the moving mirror. The
recombined light is focused on the sample and reflected or transmitted
light is refocused onto a detector.  The difference in optical path
length between the two arms to the interferometer is known as the
retardation or optical path difference (OPD). An interferogram is
obtained by varying the retardation and recording the signal from the
detector for various values of the retardation. The interferogram when
no sample is present is used as a reference to compare. When a sample
is present the background interferogram is modulated by the presence
of absorption bands in the sample. The interferogram is converted to a
spectrum by Fourier transformation.

- Technique uses a pulsed, tunable IR source to excite molecular
absorption in a sample. As the sample absorbs radiation, it heats up,
leading to rapid thermal expansion that excites resonant oscillations
of the cantilever of an atomic force microscope (AFM), which is
detected using the standard AFM photodiode measurement system. These
induced oscillations decay in a characteristic ringdown that can be
analyzed  to extract the amplitudes and frequencies of the
oscillations. By measuring the amplitudes of the cantilever
oscillation as a function of the source wavelength, local absorption
spectra are created. (https://doi.org/10.1016/S1369-7021(10)70205-4)

######  Atomic Absorption Spectrometry


- Child of:
 [`opticalspectrometry`](#opticalspectrometry)

- Atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) detects elements in either
liquid or solid samples through the application of characteristic
wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation from a light source.
Individual elements will absorb wavelengths differently, and these
absorbances are measured against standards.
(https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/industrial/spectroscopy-
elemental-isotope-analysis/spectroscopy-elemental-isotope-analysis-
learning-center/trace-elemental-analysis-tea-information/atomic-
absorption-aa-information.html). Atomic absorption spectroscopy is
based on absorption of light by free metallic ions. It requires
standards with known analyte content to establish the relation between
the measured absorbance and the analyte concentration and relies
therefore on the Beer-Lambert law. In order to analyze a sample for
its atomic constituents, it has to be atomized. The atomizers most
commonly used nowadays are flames and electrothermal (graphite tube)
atomizers. The atoms should then be irradiated by optical radiation,
and the radiation source could be an element-specific line radiation
source or a continuum radiation source. The radiation then passes
through a monochromator in order to separate the element-specific
radiation from any other radiation emitted by the radiation source,
which is finally measured by a detector.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_absorption_spectroscopy)
- analytical technique used to measure a wide range of elements in
materials such as metals, pottery and glass. Although it is a
destructive technique (unlike ED-XRF), the sample size needed is very
small (typically about 10 milligrams - i.e. one hundredth of a gram)
and its removal causes little damage. The sample is accurately weighed
and then dissolved, often using strong acids. The resulting solution
is sprayed into the flame of the instrument and atomized. Light of a
suitable wavelength for a particular element is shone through the
flame, and some of this light is absorbed by the atoms of the sample.
The amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of
the element in the solution, and hence in the original object.
Measurements are made separately for each element of interest in turn
to achieve a complete analysis of an object, and thus the technique is
relatively slow to use. However, it is very sensitive and it can
measure trace elements down to the part per million level, as well as
being able to measure elements present in minor and major amounts.

######  X-ray absorption spectrometry


- Child of:
 [`xrayspectrometry`](#xrayspectrometry)

- In this technique, the sample is exposed to monochromatic x-rays for
which the photon energy is tuned to a range where core electrons can
be excited (0.1-100 keV). When the incident x-ray energy is larger
than the electron binding energy, there is a sharp increase in
absorption (an edge). The edge positions are related to the core
electron that is excited. Each element has its own edge energy, and an
element's valence can be measured even in a heterogeneous sample.
There are three main regions found on a spectrum generated by XAS data
which are treated as separate spectroscopic techniques: 1) absorption
threshold determined by the transition to the lowest unoccupied
states; 2) near-edge structure (XANES); 3) Extended X-ray absorption
fine structure (EXAFS) (at energy higher than the edge). X-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is used for determining the local
geometric and/or electronic structure of matter. The experiment is
usually performed at synchrotron radiation facilities, which provide
intense and tunable X-ray beams. Samples can be in the gas phase,
solutions, or solids.

#######  X-ray absorption near edge structure spectrometry


- Child of:
 [`xrayabsorptionspectrometry`](#xrayabsorptionspectrometry)

- This technique is based on the absorption of an x-ray photon, in
which an electron interacts with an incident x-ray to acquire a time
dependent acceleration. The electron may then be promoted from a core-
orbital to an unoccupied bound or continuum state with an intensity
given by Fermi's Golden Rule. By varying the energy of a
monochromatized beam of incident photons, a spectrum of the absorption
cross section can be generated. The probability of an excitation
sharply increases when the energy of the incident photon reaches the
binding energy of a core-electron. In X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
(XAS) this is referred to as an edge. XANES is a subset of XAS in
which the local electronic structure is characterized by investigating
the absorption cross section within 50-100 eV of an edge. The XANES
region is sensitive to a wealth of electronic structure information,
which may be analyzed in three sections. Before the edge, the
intensity of pre-edge features is greatly affected by the coordination
geometry of the central atom. At the edge, formal oxidation state may
be qualitatively assigned, as the energy of the edge position is not
an invariant quantity for a given element, the position shifts in
accordance with electron density. Finally, coordination shells are
interrogated just beyond the edge as the emitted photoelectron
scatters off neighboring atoms.

[]{#totalreflectionxrayfluorescencespectrometry}

#######  Total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry


- Child of:
 [`xrayfluorescencespectrometry`](#xrayfluorescencespectrometry)

- a surface elemental analysis technique often used for the ultra-
trace analysis of particles, residues, and impurities on smooth
surfaces. TXRF is essentially an energy dispersive XRF technique
arranged in a special geometry. An incident beam impinges upon a
polished flat sample carrier at angles below the critical angle of
external total reflection for X-rays, resulting in the reflection of
most of the excitation beam photons at this surface. Since Total
Reflection angle depends on the energy of the photon, one can use this
effect to eliminate the high energy photons from the excitation
spectrum and minimize their contribution to the background in the
measured spectra, thus making possible to achieve better detection
limits. Due to this configuration, the measured spectral background in
TXRF is less than in conventional XRF. This reduction results in
increased signal to noise ratio. (https://www-

scattering. (Source: IUAPC; https://iupac.org/wp-

spectroscopy is commonly used in chemistry to provide a structural
fingerprint by which molecules can be identified. This technique uses
a source of monochromatic electromagnetic radiation to interact with
molecular vibrations, phonons or other excitations in the analyzed
sample resulting in the energy of the incident photons being shifted
up or down. The light source is typically a laser in the visible, near
infrared, or near ultraviolet range, although X-rays can also be used.
The shift in energy from the incident source gives information about
the vibrational modes in the analyzed sample.  Electromagnetic
radiation from the illuminated spot is collected with a lens and sent
through a monochromator. Elastic scattered radiation at the wavelength
corresponding to the incident excitation is filtered out, while the
rest of the collected light is dispersed onto a detector.

- a sharp probe tip mounted on a microcantilever scans over the

surface is generated by 'feeling' rather than 'looking.'
(https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-16712-6_496).  As the tip
approaches the surface, the close-range, attractive forces between the
surface and the tip causes the cantilever to deflect towards the
surface. However, as the cantilever is brought even closer to the
surface, until the tip makes contact with it, increasingly repulsive
forces takes over and causes the cantilever to deflect away from the
surface. (https://lnf-

- Scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) is a Contact Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM) technique that allows spatial mapping of temperature
or thermal conductivity across a sample surface in addition to
topography. (C.Daniel Frisbie, in Encyclopedia of Physical Science and
Technology (Third Edition), 2003). This is a type of Scanning probe
microscopy (SPM), a branch of microscopy that forms images of surfaces
using a physical probe that scans the specimen
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_probe_microscopy). When the
tip is placed in contact with the sample, heat flows from the tip to
sample. As the probe is scanned, the amount of heat flow changes. By
monitoring the heat flow, one can create a thermal map of the sample,
revealing spatial variations in thermal conductivity in a sample.

- Like fission-track dating, alpha-recoil track (ART) dating is based
on the accumulation of nuclear particles that are released by natural
radioactivity and produce etchable tracks in solids. ARTs are formed
during the alpha-decay of uranium and thorium as well as of their
daughter nuclei. When emitting an alpha-particle, the heavy remaining
nucleus recoils 30-40 nm, leaving behind a trail of radiation damage.
Through etching the ART tracks become visible with interference phase-
contrast microscopy. Alpha-recoil dating has a great potential for
Quaternary chronometry and tephrochronology.

####  Combustion analysis


- Child of:
 [`wetchemistry`](#wetchemistry)

- Technique for determination of empirical and molecular formulas for
compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen (CaHb) or carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen (CaHbOc). The steps for this procedure are: 1)
Weigh a sample of the compound to be analyzed; 2) Burn the compound
completely. 3)  H2O and CO2 are drawn through two tubes. One tube
contains a substance that absorbs water, and the other contains a
substance that absorbs carbon dioxide. Weigh each of these tubes
before and after the combustion. The increase in mass in the first
tube is the mass of H2O that formed in the combustion, and the
increase in mass for the second tube is the mass of CO2 formed. Assume
that all the carbon in the compound has been converted to CO2 and
trapped in the second tube. Calculate the mass of carbon in the
compound from the mass of carbon in the measured mass of CO2 formed.
Assume that all of the hydrogen in the compound has been converted to
H2O and trapped in the first tube. Calculate the mass of hydrogen in
the compound from the mass of hydrogen in the measured mass of water.
If the compound contains oxygen as well as carbon and hydrogen,
calculate the mass of the oxygen by subtracting the mass of carbon and
hydrogen from the total mass of the original sample of compound.

analysis measures the weight or concentration of a solid that has
either formed from a precipitate or dissolved in a liquid. (
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_chemistry#Gravimetric_analysis ).
Gravimeters can be regarded as special-purpose accelerometers.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravimetry). An accelerometer is a
damped mass, a proof mass, on a spring. When the accelerometer
experiences an acceleration, the mass is moved to the point that the
spring can push (accelerate) the mass at the same speed as the casing.
The measurement of the spring's compression measures the acceleration.

###  X-Ray Diffraction


- Child of:
 [`analyticalmethod`](#analyticalmethod)

- Measurement method using diffraction of X-radiation to obtain the
spatial arrangement of atoms in a crystalline sample. X-ray
diffraction is based on constructive interference of monochromatic
X-rays and a crystalline sample. These X-rays are generated by a
cathode ray tube, filtered to produce monochromatic radiation,
collimated to concentrate, and directed toward the sample. The
interaction of the incident rays with the sample produces constructive
interference (and a diffracted ray) when conditions satisfy Bragg's
Law (n*'lambda'=2d*sin(theta)). This law relates the wavelength of
electromagnetic radiation to the diffraction angle and the lattice
spacing in a crystalline sample. These diffracted X-rays are then
detected, processed and counted. By changing the geometry of the
incident rays, the sample, and the detector, all possible diffraction
directions of the lattice should be attained.(https://serc.carleton.ed
u/research_education/geochemsheets/techniques/XRD.html) Copper K-a
radiation (l = 0.15406 nm, E = 8.04 keV) is typically used for routine
XRD. (Source: IUPAC; https://doi.org/10.1515/pac-2019-0302).

[]{#singlecrystalxraydiffraction}

####  Single Crystal X-Ray Diffraction


- Child of:
 [`xraydiffraction`](#xraydiffraction)

- Single-crystal X-ray Diffraction is a non-destructive analytical
technique which provides detailed information about the internal
lattice of crystalline substances, including unit cell dimensions,
bond-lengths, bond-angles, and details of site-ordering. X-ray
diffraction is based on constructive interference of monochromatic
X-rays and a crystalline sample. These X-rays are generated by a
cathode ray tube, filtered to produce monochromatic radiation,
collimated to concentrate, and directed toward the sample. The
interaction of the incident rays with the sample produces constructive
interference (and a diffracted ray) when conditions satisfy Bragg's
Law (n*'lambda'=2d*sin(theta)). This law relates the wavelength of
electromagnetic radiation to the diffraction angle and the lattice
spacing in a crystalline sample. These diffracted X-rays are then
detected, processed and counted. By changing the geometry of the
incident rays, the orientation of the centered crystal and the
detector, all possible diffraction directions of the lattice should be
attained. Single-crystal diffractometers use either 3- or 4-circle
goniometers. These circles refer to the four angles (2*theta, 'chi',
'phi', and 'omega') that define the relationship between the crystal
lattice, the incident ray and detector. Samples are mounted on thin
glass fibers which are attached to brass pins and mounted onto
goniometer heads. Adjustment of the X, Y and Z orthogonal directions
allows centering of the crystal within the X-ray beam. Single-crystal
X-ray diffraction is most commonly used for precise determination of a
unit cell, including cell dimensions and positions of atoms within the
lattice. (https://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/geochemsheets/t

- Child of:
 [`xraydiffraction`](#xraydiffraction)

- X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) is a rapid analytical technique
primarily used for phase identification of a crystalline material and
can provide information on unit cell dimensions. The analyzed material
is finely ground, homogenized, and average bulk composition is
determined. The geometry of an X-ray diffractometer is such that the
sample rotates in the path of the collimated X-ray beam at an angle
theta while the X-ray detector is mounted on an arm to collect the
diffracted X-rays and rotates at an angle of 2*theta. The instrument
used to maintain the angle and rotate the sample is termed a
goniometer. For typical powder patterns, data is collected at 2theta
from ~5degree to 70degree, angles that are preset in the X-ray scan.
X-ray powder diffraction is most widely used for the identification of
unknown crystalline materials (e.g. minerals, inorganic compounds). (h

####  Chromatography separation


- Child of:
 [`analyticalseparation`](#analyticalseparation)

- a laboratory technique for the separation of a mixture into its
components. The mixture is dissolved in a fluid solvent (gas or
liquid) called the mobile phase, which carries it through a system (a
column, a capillary tube, a plate, or a sheet) on which a material
called the stationary phase is fixed. The different constituents of
the mixture travel at different apparent velocities in the mobile
fluid, causing them to separate. The separation is based on the
differential partitioning between the mobile and the stationary
phases. Chromatography separation is preparative;  purpose is to
separate the components of a mixture for later use, and is thus a form

[]{#electromigrationtechnique}

####  Electrokinetic separation


- Child of:
 [`analyticalseparation`](#analyticalseparation)

- a technique to transport charged particles and fluid in an electric
potential by applying an electrical current from direct power source
to electrodes placed in a sample (typically liquid), resulting in
migration of ions. Although many types of migrations occur in tandem
with the current there are two driving migrations within
electrokinetics; ionic migration and electrophoresis. The migration of
the analytes is initiated by an electric field applied between the
source and destination vials. In the most common mode, all ions,
positive or negative, are pulled through a conductive medium in the
same direction by electroosmotic flow. The analytes separate as they
migrate due to their electrophoretic mobility. (https://iopscience.iop
.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/226/1/012075/pdf,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrokinetic_remediation,
https://doi.org/10.1515/pac-2017-0111) Most common application seems
to be remmoval of contaminants in soil.

[]{#electronionization}

####  Electron ionization


- Child of:
 [`ionsource`](#ionsource)

- Ionization in a gas-phase reaction described by the following
equation:  M + e- >>  M+ + 2e- .  where M is the neutral molecule
undergoing ionization, e- is the electron, and M+ is the resulting
charged radical cation. Uncharged molecules in the gas phase are
bombarded with a stream of electrons that are accelerated through an
electric field at an ion energy of 70 eV. The potential difference
energizes the electron source, such that collision with neutral
molecules results in the ejection of two electrons and the formation
of a charged radical cation. (Stefani N. Thomas, in Contemporary
Practice in Clinical Chemistry (Fourth Edition), 2019)
