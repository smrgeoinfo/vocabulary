containing cells or particles is suspended in a fluid and injected
into the flow cytometer instrument. The sample is focused to ideally
flow one cell at a time through a laser beam, where the light
scattered is characteristic to the cells and their components. Cells
are often labeled with fluorescent markers so light is absorbed and
then emitted in a band of wavelengths. Tens of thousands of cells can

to a fine spot (with the typical spot size 0.05 – 0.2 nm) which is
then scanned over the sample in a raster illumination system
constructed so that the sample is illuminated at each point with the
beam parallel to the optical axis.

- An instrument that measures the signal produced by nuclear magnetic
resonance of the atomic nuclei in a sample when exposed to excitation
by radio waves. The electromagnetic waves emitted by the nuclei of the
sample as a result of perturbation by a weak oscillating magnetic
field are detected with sensitive radio receivers. Upon excitation of
the sample with a radio frequency (60–1000 MHz) pulse, a nuclear
magnetic resonance response - a free induction decay (FID) - is
obtained. It is a very weak signal, and requires sensitive radio
receivers to pick up. A Fourier transform is carried out to extract
the frequency-domain spectrum from the raw time-domain FID.

[]{#confocallaserscanningmicroscope}

#####  Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope


- Child of:
 [`microscope`](#microscope)

- optical imaging instrument that increases  optical resolution and
contrast by means of a spatial pinhole to block out-of-focus light in
image formation. Capturing multiple two-dimensional images at
different depths in a sample enables the reconstruction of three-
dimensional structures (a process known as optical sectioning) within
an object. A confocal microscope focuses a small beam of light at one
narrow depth level at a time to achieve a controlled and highly
limited depth of field.  The point illumination and a pinhole in an
optically conjugate plane in front of the detector eliminate out-of-
focus signal – the name 'confocal' stems from this configuration. As
only light from  very close to the focal plane can be detected, the
image's optical resolution, particularly in the sample depth
direction, is much better than that of wide-field microscopes. Much of
the light is blocked at the pinhole resulting in decreased signal
intensity, so long exposures are often required. To offset this drop
in signal after the pinhole, the light intensity is detected by a
sensitive detector, usually a photomultiplier tube (PMT) or avalanche
photodiode, transforming the light signal into an electrical one.  As
only one point in the sample is illuminated at a time, 2D or 3D
imaging requires scanning over a regular raster in the specimen.

[]{#photometer}

###  Photometer


- Child of:
 [`analyticalinstrument`](#analyticalinstrument)

- an instrument that measures the strength of electromagnetic
radiation in the range from ultraviolet to infrared and including the
visible spectrum. Most photometers convert light into an electric
current using a photoresistor, photodiode, or photomultiplier.  To
analyze the light, the photometer may measure the light after it has
passed through a filter or through a monochromator for determination
at defined wavelengths or for analysis of the spectral distribution of
the light (see spectrophotometer, spectrometer).

REC-06-04-06)[Summary provided by CEMS].  Newly developed Time of
Flight instrumentation is augmenting more traditional quadruple and
magnetic sector based instrumentation. Laser ablation, graphite
furnace, liquid and gas chromatographic interfacing has facilitated
the analysis of a significantly increased variety of sample types,
enabling the determination of up to sixty elements in samples as small

####  Single Crystal X-Ray Diffractometer


- Child of:
 [`xraydiffractometer`](#xraydiffractometer)

- Diffractometer designed to analyze the structure of a single
crystal. Single-crystal diffractometers use either 3- or 4-circle
goniometers. These circles refer to the four angles (2, 'chi', 'phi',
and 'omega') that define the relationship between the crystal lattice,
the incident ray and detector. Samples are mounted on thin glass
fibers which are attached to brass pins and mounted onto goniometer
heads. Adjustment of the X, Y and Z orthogonal directions allows
centering of the crystal within the X-ray beam. Modern single-crystal
diffractometers use CCD (charge-coupled device) technology to
transform the X-ray photons into an electrical signal which are then
sent to a computer for processing. (https://serc.carleton.edu/research

[]{#xraypowderdiffractometer}

####  X-Ray Powder Diffractometer


- Child of:
 [`xraydiffractometer`](#xraydiffractometer)

- X-ray diffractometer with the geometry configured such that the
sample rotates in the path of the collimated X-ray beam at an angle
theta while the X-ray detector is mounted on an arm to collect the
diffracted X-rays and rotates at an angle of 2*theta. The instrument
used to maintain the angle and rotate the sample is termed a
goniometer. For typical powder patterns, data is collected at 2theta
from ~5degree to 70degree, angles that are preset in the X-ray scan. (

###  Chromatography analysis


- Child of:
 [`analyticalmethod`](#analyticalmethod)

- a laboratory technique for the separation of a mixture into its
components. The mixture is dissolved in a fluid solvent (gas or
liquid) called the mobile phase, which carries it through a system (a
column, a capillary tube, a plate, or a sheet) on which a material
called the stationary phase is fixed. The different constituents of
the mixture travel at different apparent velocities in the mobile
fluid, causing them to separate. The separation is based on the
differential partitioning between the mobile and the stationary
phases. The purpose of chromatography analysis is to establish the
presence or measure the relative proportions of analytes in a mixture.
The result is a chromatogram

 [`massspectrometry`](#massspectrometry)

- technique used to separate, detect, identify, and quantify
components of a complex mixture. The solid sample is extracted in a
solvent to pull out soluble target compounds; this creates both a
solid residue and a liquid extract.  The extract can be subjected to
additional procedures, for cleanup or exposure to acid vapor to break
apart large molecules.  The final extracted solution is injected into
the LC, which separates compounds in the solution and then passes them
into the MS, where their mass spectra are measured. Each time point on
the chromatogram is linked to a mass spectrum from which the most
intense signals are fragmented at defined CID (colision induced
dissociation) energy.  The combination of retention time (i.e., how
long it takes for the compound to pass through the LC) and mass
spectrum allows for identification of the compounds when compared to
standards.  The LC-MS-MS converted data is in a unversal format of
data called mzML and used internationally in LC-MS-MS analytical
community of small molecules, peptides to proteins.  mzML is a
universal Mass spectrometry format. xml namespace

-  a flat/polished crystalline specimen is placed in the SEM chamber
at a highly tilted angle (~70degree from horizontal) towards the
diffraction camera, to increase the contrast in the resultant electron
backscatter diffraction pattern. The phosphor screen is located within
the specimen chamber of the SEM at an angle of approximately 90degree
to the pole piece and is coupled to a compact lens which focuses the
image from the phosphor screen onto the CCD camera. In this
configuration, some of the electrons which enter the sample
backscatter and may escape. As these electrons leave the sample, they
may exit at the Bragg condition related to the spacing of the periodic
atomic lattice planes of the crystalline structure and diffract. These
diffracted electrons can escape the material and some will collide and
excite the phosphor causing it to fluoresce.

fluorescence emission. Thus, using fluorescence microscopy, the
precise location of intracellular components labeled with specific
fluorophores can be monitored, as well as their associated diffusion
coefficients, transport characteristics, and interactions with other

localized environmental variables enables the investigation of pH,
viscosity, refractive index, ionic concentrations, membrane potential,
and solvent polarity in living cells and tissues. Fluorescence is the

materials. The dry sample is usually evacuated of all gas and cooled
to a temperature of 77K, the temperature of liquid nitrogen. At this
temperature inert gases such as nitrogen, argon and krypton will
physically adsorb on the surface of the sample. This adsorption
process can be considered to be a reversible condensation or layering
of molecules on the sample surface during which heat is evolved.

[]{#atomprobetomography}

####  Atom probe tomography


- Child of:
 [`other`](#other)

- To conduct an atom probe experiment a very sharp needle shaped
specimen is placed in an ultra high vacuum chamber. After introduction
into the vacuum system, the sample is reduced to cryogenic
temperatures (typically 20-100 K) and manipulated such that the
needle's point is aimed towards an ion detector. A high voltage is
applied to the specimen, and either a laser pulse is applied to the
specimen or a voltage pulse (typically 1-2 kV) with pulse repetition
rates in the hundreds of kilohertz range is applied to a counter
electrode. The application of the pulse to the sample allows for
individual atoms at the sample surface to be ejected as an ion from
the sample surface at a known time. Typically the pulse amplitude and
the high voltage on the specimen are computer controlled to encourage
only one atom to ionize at a time, but multiple ionizations are
possible. The delay between application of the pulse and detection of
the ion(s) at the detector allow for the computation of a mass-to-
charge ratio. The method is destructive in nature removing ions from a
sample surface in order to image and identify them, generating
magnifications sufficient to observe individual atoms as they are
removed from the sample surface. Through coupling of this
magnification method with time of flight mass spectrometry, ions
evaporated by application of electric pulses can have their mass-to-
charge ratio computed. Through successive evaporation of material,
layers of atoms are removed from a specimen, allowing for probing not
only of the surface, but also through the material itself.The
instrument allows the three-dimensional reconstruction of up to
billions of atoms from a sharp tip (corresponding to specimen volumes
of 10,000-10,000,000 nm3). (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_probe)

- [might be: ]The Model 510 Moisture Analyzer (E. I. du Pont de
Nemours & Co.) the sensing element is a quartz crystal coated with a
hygroscopic material. The resonant frequency of such a crystal depends
on the crystal mass (King, 1964). The mass (and, hence, resonant
frequency) changes with the adsorption of moisture. A typical
sensitivity factor is about 1 Hz per A thickness of added material.
Two crystals are alternately exposed to sample air and dry air. The
frequency difference between the two is indicated on the analyzer
scale in parts per million (ppm) water vapor by volume.

proton, which is why the Nuclear Microprobe is also sometimes called
the Scanning Proton Microprobe. However, other MeV light ions can
generate the same analytical signals as protons, and are preferred for
some of the analytical techniques described. The focused beam is
scanned over the sample surface, and the strength of the relevant
analytical signal is measured at each position in the scanned area to
generate an image of the sample. There are many different types of
interaction that can occur when an MeV ion is incident on a sample,
and each one forms the basis of an analytical technique: Particle-

2) the difference between the electrical powers into a sample and a
reference material is measured (power compensation DSC). (Source:
IUPAC; https://doi.org/10.1515/pac-2012-0609).
- a technique in which the difference in the amount of heat required
to increase the temperature of a sample and reference is measured as a
function of temperature. Both the sample and reference are maintained
at nearly the same temperature throughout the experiment. Generally,
the temperature program for a DSC analysis is designed such that the
sample holder temperature increases linearly as a function of time.
The reference sample should have a well-defined heat capacity over the
range of temperatures to be scanned. By observing the difference in
heat flow between the sample and reference, differential scanning
calorimeters are able to measure the amount of heat absorbed or
released during phase transitions. DSC may also be used to observe
more subtle physical changes, such as glass transitions. It is widely
used in industrial settings as a quality control instrument due to its
applicability in evaluating sample purity and for studying polymer
curing.

topography. (C.Daniel Frisbie, in Encyclopedia of Physical Science and
Technology (Third Edition), 2003). This is a type of Scanning probe
microscopy (SPM), a branch of microscopy that forms images of surfaces
using a physical probe that scans the specimen
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_probe_microscopy). When the
tip is placed in contact with the sample, heat flows from the tip to
sample. As the probe is scanned, the amount of heat flow changes. By
monitoring the heat flow, one can create a thermal map of the sample,
revealing spatial variations in thermal conductivity in a sample.

 [`spectrometry`](#spectrometry)

- a technique used to date materials by measuring the amount of
unpaired electrons in crystalline structures that were previously
exposed to natural radiation. The age of a substance can be determined
by measuring the dosage of radiation since the time of its formation.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_spin_resonance_dating).
electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy is a method for studying
materials that have unpaired electrons. The basic concepts of EPR are
analogous to those of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), but the spins
excited are those of the electrons instead of the atomic nuclei.

[]{#massspectrometry}

####  Mass spectrometry


- Child of:
 [`particlespectrometry`](#particlespectrometry)
 [`spectrometry`](#spectrometry)

- atomic mass spectrometric analysis involves: (1) atomization, (2)
conversion of a substantial fraction of the atoms formed in step 1 to
a stream of ions (usually singly charged positive ions), (3)
separating the ions formed in step 2 on the basis of their mass-to-
charge ratio (m/z), where m is the mass number of the ion and z is the
number of fundamental charges that it bears, and (4) counting the
number of ions of each type or measuring the ion current produced when
the ions formed from the sample strike a suitable transducer.  (Skoog,
Holler & Crouch, p. 253).  Molecular mass spectrometry is used to
determine the structures of inorganic, organic, and biological
molecules and the qualitative and quantitative composition of complex
mixtures; The appearance of mass spectra for a given molecular species
strongly depends on the method used for ion formation. That these
methods fall into three major categories: gas-phase sources,
desorption sources, and ambient desorption sources. (Skoog, Holler &
Crouch, p. 502)

- Mass spectrometry technique. Components: 1) sample preparation:
chemical concentration of analyte; 2) ionization: ion beam; 3) mass
analyzer: accelerator Mass spectrometer; 4) detector: not specified.
In this technique, the target element is first chemically separated
from the sample before it is placed in a sample holder in the AMS
instrument. The sample element is then bombarded by cesium ions to
sputter the analyte element from the sample as negative ions. The
analyte ions are then accelerated down a beam tube by a positive
potential difference of several million volts, passed through an
electron stripper to convert them to positive ions, and accelerated
back down the beam tube toward common potential where ion velocities
approach a few percent of the speed of light. Using a series of
magnetic and electrostatic mass filters, the ion beam containing all
isotopes of the analyte element is then separated into separate beams
containing the (usually unstable) isotope of interest and other
isotopes, and each of the isotopes is counted by a separate detector.

######  Gas Chromatography-Combustion-Isotopic Ratio Mass Spectrometry


- Child of:
 [`isotoperatiomassspectrometry`](#isotoperatiomassspectrometry)

- Gas chromatography combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry
(GC/C/IRMS) is a highly specialised instrumental technique used to
ascertain the realative ratio of light stable isotopes of carbon
(13C/12C), hydrogen (2H/1H), nitrogen (15N/14N) or oxygen (18O/160) in
individual compounds separated from often complex mixtures of
components. the sample solution is injected into the GC inlet where it
is vaporized and swept onto a chromatographic column by the carrier
gas (usually helium). The sample flows through the column and the
compounds comprising the mixture of interest are separated by virtue
of their relative interaction with the coating of the column
(stationary phase) and the carrier gas (mobile phase). Carbon and
nitrogen compounds eluting from the chromatographic column then pass
through a combustion reactor (an alumina tube containing Cu, Ni and Pt
wires maintained at 940 ºC) where they are oxidatively combusted. This
is followed by a reduction reactor (an alumina tube containing three
Cu wires maintained at 600 ºC) to reduce any nitrogen oxides to
nitrogen. For hydrogen and oxygen a high temperature thermal
conversion reactor is required. Water is then removed in a water
separator by passing the gas stream through a tube constructed from a
water permeable nafion membrane. The sample is then introduced into
the ion source of the mass analyzer by an open split interface, and
particles with m/z ratios of interest are counted by detectors..
