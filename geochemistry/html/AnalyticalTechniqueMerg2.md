containing cells or particles is suspended in a fluid and injected
into the flow cytometer instrument. The sample is focused to ideally
flow one cell at a time through a laser beam, where the light
scattered is characteristic to the cells and their components. Cells
are often labeled with fluorescent markers so light is absorbed and
then emitted in a band of wavelengths. Tens of thousands of cells can

to a fine spot (with the typical spot size 0.05 – 0.2 nm) which is
then scanned over the sample in a raster illumination system
constructed so that the sample is illuminated at each point with the
beam parallel to the optical axis.

- An instrument that measures the signal produced by nuclear magnetic
resonance of the atomic nuclei in a sample when exposed to excitation
by radio waves. The electromagnetic waves emitted by the nuclei of the
sample as a result of perturbation by a weak oscillating magnetic
field are detected with sensitive radio receivers. Upon excitation of
the sample with a radio frequency (60–1000 MHz) pulse, a nuclear
magnetic resonance response - a free induction decay (FID) - is
obtained. It is a very weak signal, and requires sensitive radio
receivers to pick up. A Fourier transform is carried out to extract
the frequency-domain spectrum from the raw time-domain FID.

[]{#confocallaserscanningmicroscope}

#####  Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope


- Child of:
 [`microscope`](#microscope)

- optical imaging instrument that increases  optical resolution and
contrast by means of a spatial pinhole to block out-of-focus light in
image formation. Capturing multiple two-dimensional images at
different depths in a sample enables the reconstruction of three-
dimensional structures (a process known as optical sectioning) within
an object. A confocal microscope focuses a small beam of light at one
narrow depth level at a time to achieve a controlled and highly
limited depth of field.  The point illumination and a pinhole in an
optically conjugate plane in front of the detector eliminate out-of-
focus signal – the name 'confocal' stems from this configuration. As
only light from  very close to the focal plane can be detected, the
image's optical resolution, particularly in the sample depth
direction, is much better than that of wide-field microscopes. Much of
the light is blocked at the pinhole resulting in decreased signal
intensity, so long exposures are often required. To offset this drop
in signal after the pinhole, the light intensity is detected by a
sensitive detector, usually a photomultiplier tube (PMT) or avalanche
photodiode, transforming the light signal into an electrical one.  As
only one point in the sample is illuminated at a time, 2D or 3D
imaging requires scanning over a regular raster in the specimen.

[]{#photometer}

###  Photometer


- Child of:
 [`analyticalinstrument`](#analyticalinstrument)

- an instrument that measures the strength of electromagnetic
radiation in the range from ultraviolet to infrared and including the
visible spectrum. Most photometers convert light into an electric
current using a photoresistor, photodiode, or photomultiplier.  To
analyze the light, the photometer may measure the light after it has
passed through a filter or through a monochromator for determination
at defined wavelengths or for analysis of the spectral distribution of
the light (see spectrophotometer, spectrometer).

####  Single Crystal X-Ray Diffractometer


- Child of:
 [`xraydiffractometer`](#xraydiffractometer)

- Diffractometer designed to analyze the structure of a single
crystal. Single-crystal diffractometers use either 3- or 4-circle
goniometers. These circles refer to the four angles (2, 'chi', 'phi',
and 'omega') that define the relationship between the crystal lattice,
the incident ray and detector. Samples are mounted on thin glass
fibers which are attached to brass pins and mounted onto goniometer
heads. Adjustment of the X, Y and Z orthogonal directions allows
centering of the crystal within the X-ray beam. Modern single-crystal
diffractometers use CCD (charge-coupled device) technology to
transform the X-ray photons into an electrical signal which are then
sent to a computer for processing. (https://serc.carleton.edu/research

[]{#xraypowderdiffractometer}

####  X-Ray Powder Diffractometer


- Child of:
 [`xraydiffractometer`](#xraydiffractometer)

- X-ray diffractometer with the geometry configured such that the
sample rotates in the path of the collimated X-ray beam at an angle
theta while the X-ray detector is mounted on an arm to collect the
diffracted X-rays and rotates at an angle of 2*theta. The instrument
used to maintain the angle and rotate the sample is termed a
goniometer. For typical powder patterns, data is collected at 2theta
from ~5degree to 70degree, angles that are preset in the X-ray scan. (

###  Chromatography analysis


- Child of:

- a laboratory technique for the separation of a mixture into its
components. The mixture is dissolved in a fluid solvent (gas or
liquid) called the mobile phase, which carries it through a system (a
column, a capillary tube, a plate, or a sheet) on which a material
called the stationary phase is fixed. The different constituents of
the mixture travel at different apparent velocities in the mobile
fluid, causing them to separate. The separation is based on the
differential partitioning between the mobile and the stationary
phases. The purpose of chromatography analysis is to establish the
presence or measure the relative proportions of analytes in a mixture.
The result is a chromatogram

anaerobic, and whether chemical compounds such as Fe oxides or nitrate
have been chemically reduced or are present in their oxidized forms.
The redox potential is used to describe a system's overall reducing or

crystal structure of materials. When the electron beam is projected
onto a specimen, its crystal lattice acts as a diffraction grating,
scattering the electrons in a predictable manner, and resulting in a
diffraction pattern. Electron diffraction patterns are mainly
contributed by elastic scattering. (X Zhou, G.E. Thompson, in

####  Electron Backscatter Diffraction
* `Electron backscatter diffraction`


- Child of:
 [`electrondiffraction`](#electrondiffraction)

-  a flat/polished crystalline specimen is placed in the SEM chamber
at a highly tilted angle (~70degree from horizontal) towards the
diffraction camera, to increase the contrast in the resultant electron
backscatter diffraction pattern. The phosphor screen is located within
the specimen chamber of the SEM at an angle of approximately 90degree
to the pole piece and is coupled to a compact lens which focuses the
image from the phosphor screen onto the CCD camera. In this
configuration, some of the electrons which enter the sample
backscatter and may escape. As these electrons leave the sample, they
may exit at the Bragg condition related to the spacing of the periodic
atomic lattice planes of the crystalline structure and diffract. These
diffracted electrons can escape the material and some will collide and
excite the phosphor causing it to fluoresce.

- Child of:

- Fluorescence microscopy is capable of imaging the distribution of a
single molecular species based solely on the properties of
fluorescence emission. Thus, using fluorescence microscopy, the
precise location of intracellular components labeled with specific
fluorophores can be monitored, as well as their associated diffusion
coefficients, transport characteristics, and interactions with other
biomolecules. In addition, the dramatic response in fluorescence to
localized environmental variables enables the investigation of pH,
viscosity, refractive index, ionic concentrations, membrane potential,
and solvent polarity in living cells and tissues. Fluorescence is the
property of some atoms and molecules to absorb light at a particular
wavelength and to subsequently emit light of longer wavelength after a
brief interval, termed the fluorescence lifetime.  http://micro.magnet

- The gas adsorption technique may used to measure the specific
surface area and pore size distribution of powdered or solid
materials. The dry sample is usually evacuated of all gas and cooled
to a temperature of 77K, the temperature of liquid nitrogen. At this
temperature inert gases such as nitrogen, argon and krypton will
physically adsorb on the surface of the sample. This adsorption
process can be considered to be a reversible condensation or layering
of molecules on the sample surface during which heat is evolved.
Nitrogen gas is ideal for measuring surface area and pore size
distribution.

[]{#atomprobetomography}

####  Atom probe tomography


- Child of:
 [`other`](#other)

- To conduct an atom probe experiment a very sharp needle shaped
specimen is placed in an ultra high vacuum chamber. After introduction
into the vacuum system, the sample is reduced to cryogenic
temperatures (typically 20-100 K) and manipulated such that the
needle's point is aimed towards an ion detector. A high voltage is
applied to the specimen, and either a laser pulse is applied to the
specimen or a voltage pulse (typically 1-2 kV) with pulse repetition
rates in the hundreds of kilohertz range is applied to a counter
electrode. The application of the pulse to the sample allows for
individual atoms at the sample surface to be ejected as an ion from
the sample surface at a known time. Typically the pulse amplitude and
the high voltage on the specimen are computer controlled to encourage
only one atom to ionize at a time, but multiple ionizations are
possible. The delay between application of the pulse and detection of
the ion(s) at the detector allow for the computation of a mass-to-
charge ratio. The method is destructive in nature removing ions from a
sample surface in order to image and identify them, generating
magnifications sufficient to observe individual atoms as they are
removed from the sample surface. Through coupling of this
magnification method with time of flight mass spectrometry, ions
evaporated by application of electric pulses can have their mass-to-
charge ratio computed. Through successive evaporation of material,
layers of atoms are removed from a specimen, allowing for probing not
only of the surface, but also through the material itself.The
instrument allows the three-dimensional reconstruction of up to
billions of atoms from a sharp tip (corresponding to specimen volumes
of 10,000-10,000,000 nm3). (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_probe)

- technique in which a beam of electrons is transmitted through a
specimen to form an image. The specimen is most often an ultrathin
section less than 100 nm thick or a suspension on a grid. An image is
formed from the interaction of the electrons with the sample as the
beam is transmitted through the specimen. Multiple operating modes
based on electron imaging include conventional imaging, scanning TEM
imaging (STEM), and electron diffraction.

####  Nuclear microprobe analysis


- Child of:
 [`particlebeamexcitation`](#particlebeamexcitation)

- Technique in which a focused beam of Me V light-mass ions is scanned
across a sample surface. The most commonly used Me V ion is the
proton, which is why the Nuclear Microprobe is also sometimes called
the Scanning Proton Microprobe. However, other MeV light ions can
generate the same analytical signals as protons, and are preferred for
some of the analytical techniques described. The focused beam is
scanned over the sample surface, and the strength of the relevant
analytical signal is measured at each position in the scanned area to
generate an image of the sample. There are many different types of
interaction that can occur when an MeV ion is incident on a sample,
and each one forms the basis of an analytical technique: Particle-
Induced X-Ray Emission (PIXE), Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry
(RBS), Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA) -- nuclear reaction products
such as alpha particles, protons, neutrons, or gamma rays are emitted.
The energy of these charged reaction products is measured using a
surface barrier detector . (https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1

- Within a given sample, once the x-ray intensities of each element of
interest are "counted" in a detector at a specific beam current, the
count rates are compared to those of standards containing known values
of the elements of interest. Counting is typically done using
wavelength-dispersive spectrometry. In turn, the x-ray intensities
must be corrected for matrix effects associated with atomic number

performed within a computer program that takes the raw counting rates
of each element, compares these to standards, computes the ZAF
correction (or similar type of correction) and displays the results as

tight lid) to hold the sample and a second chamber of fixed, known
(via calibration) internal volume – referred to as the reference
volume or added volume. The device has a valve to admit a gas under
pressure to one of the chambers, a pressure measuring device – usually
a transducer – connected to the first chamber, a valved pathway
connecting the two chambers, and a valved vent from the second of the
chambers. The volume of the sample is calculated from the known
volumne of the empty sample chamber, the volume of the reference
volume chamber, the pressure after gas is admitted to the sample
chamber, and the pressure after expansion of the gas into both
chambers. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_pycnometer)

Microscopy (AFM) technique that allows spatial mapping of temperature
or thermal conductivity across a sample surface in addition to
topography. (C.Daniel Frisbie, in Encyclopedia of Physical Science and
Technology (Third Edition), 2003). This is a type of Scanning probe
microscopy (SPM), a branch of microscopy that forms images of surfaces
using a physical probe that scans the specimen
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_probe_microscopy). When the
tip is placed in contact with the sample, heat flows from the tip to
sample. As the probe is scanned, the amount of heat flow changes. By
monitoring the heat flow, one can create a thermal map of the sample,
revealing spatial variations in thermal conductivity in a sample.

a stream of ions (usually singly charged positive ions), (3)
separating the ions formed in step 2 on the basis of their mass-to-

number of fundamental charges that it bears, and (4) counting the
number of ions of each type or measuring the ion current produced when
the ions formed from the sample strike a suitable transducer.  (Skoog,

determine the structures of inorganic, organic, and biological
molecules and the qualitative and quantitative composition of complex
mixtures; The appearance of mass spectra for a given molecular species
strongly depends on the method used for ion formation. That these
methods fall into three major categories: gas-phase sources,

 [`spectrometry`](#spectrometry)

- Measurement principle of spectroscopy to measure the precession of
magnetic moments placed in a magnetic induction based on absorption of
electromagnetic radiation of a specific frequency by an atomic
nucleus. Nuclei having a suitable magnetic moment include
<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>19</sup>F,
<sup>31</sup>P. The technique is used as a method of determining
structure of organic molecules, or as a mechanism for quantification.
(Source: IUPAC; https://iupac.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PAC-
REC-19-02-03.R2_PR191002MC.pdf). A spectroscopic technique that
observes the signal produced by nuclear magnetic resonance of the
atomic nuclei in a sample when exposed to excitation by radio waves.
The signal is related to local magnetic fields around atomic nuclei.
The intramolecular magnetic field around an atom in a molecule changes
the resonance frequency, thus giving access to details of the
electronic structure of a molecule and its individual functional
groups. The electromagnetic waves emitted by the nuclei of the sample
as a result of perturbation by a weak oscillating magnetic field are
detected with sensitive radio receivers. Upon excitation of the sample
with a radio frequency (60–1000 MHz) pulse, a nuclear magnetic
resonance response - a free induction decay (FID) - is obtained. It is
a very weak signal, and requires sensitive radio receivers to pick up.
A Fourier transform is carried out to extract the frequency-domain
spectrum from the raw time-domain FID. As the fields are unique or
highly characteristic to individual compounds NMR spectroscopy is the
definitive method to identify monomolecular organic compounds.

#####  Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy


- Child of:
 [`opticalspectrometry`](#opticalspectrometry)

- analytical technique used to measure a wide range of elements in
materials such as metals, pottery and glass. Although it is a
destructive technique (unlike ED-XRF), the sample size needed is very
small (typically about 10 milligrams - i.e. one hundredth of a gram)
and its removal causes little damage. The sample is accurately weighed
and then dissolved, often using strong acids. The resulting solution
is sprayed into the flame of the instrument and atomized. Light of a
suitable wavelength for a particular element is shone through the
flame, and some of this light is absorbed by the atoms of the sample.
The amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of
the element in the solution, and hence in the original object.
Measurements are made separately for each element of interest in turn
to achieve a complete analysis of an object, and thus the technique is
relatively slow to use. However, it is very sensitive and it can
measure trace elements down to the part per million level, as well as
being able to measure elements present in minor and major amounts.

- atomic mass spectrometric analysis involves: (1) atomization, (2)
conversion of a substantial fraction of the atoms formed in step 1 to
a stream of ions (usually singly charged positive ions), (3)
separating the ions formed in step 2 on the basis of their mass-to-
charge ratio (m/z), where m is the mass number of the ion and z is the
number of fundamental charges that it bears, and (4) counting the
number of ions of each type or measuring the ion current produced when
the ions formed from the sample strike a suitable transducer.  (Skoog,
Holler & Crouch, p. 253).  Molecular mass spectrometry is used to
determine the structures of inorganic, organic, and biological
molecules and the qualitative and quantitative composition of complex
mixtures; The appearance of mass spectra for a given molecular species
strongly depends on the method used for ion formation. That these
methods fall into three major categories: gas-phase sources,
desorption sources, and ambient desorption sources. (Skoog, Holler &
Crouch, p. 502)

######  Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy


- Child of:
 [`opticalspectrometry`](#opticalspectrometry)

- analytical technique used to measure a wide range of elements in
materials such as metals, pottery and glass. Although it is a
destructive technique (unlike ED-XRF), the sample size needed is very
small (typically about 10 milligrams - i.e. one hundredth of a gram)
and its removal causes little damage. The sample is accurately weighed
and then dissolved, often using strong acids. The resulting solution
is sprayed into the flame of the instrument and atomized. Light of a
suitable wavelength for a particular element is shone through the
flame, and some of this light is absorbed by the atoms of the sample.
The amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of
the element in the solution, and hence in the original object.
Measurements are made separately for each element of interest in turn
to achieve a complete analysis of an object, and thus the technique is
relatively slow to use. However, it is very sensitive and it can
measure trace elements down to the part per million level, as well as
being able to measure elements present in minor and major amounts.

- Within a given sample, once the x-ray intensities of each element of
interest are "counted" in a detector at a specific beam current, the
count rates are compared to those of standards containing known values
of the elements of interest. Counting is typically done using
wavelength-dispersive spectrometry. In turn, the x-ray intensities
must be corrected for matrix effects associated with atomic number
(Z), absorption (A) and fluorescence (F). This correction procedure is
performed within a computer program that takes the raw counting rates
of each element, compares these to standards, computes the ZAF
correction (or similar type of correction) and displays the results as
a function of the weight % of the oxides or elements.

the determination of major element concentrations or trace element
abundances in a bulk specimen. The X-ray detector utilizes a set of
diffracting crystals specially positioned to detect one characteristic
X-ray at-a-time. This sequential measurement of X-rays is termed
Wavelength Dispersive Spectroscopy (WDS). Additional information

- (EDXRF) is an X-ray Fluorescence techniques used for elemental
analysis applications. In EDXRF spectrometers, all of the elements in
the sample are excited simultaneously, and an energy dispersive
detector in combination with a multi-channel analyzer is used to
simultaneously collect the fluorescence radiation emitted from the
sample and then separate the different energies of the characteristic
radiation from each of the different sample elements. Resolution of
EDXRF systems is dependent upon the detector, and typically ranges
from 150 eV – 600 eV. The principal advantages of EDXRF systems are
their simplicity, fast operation, lack of moving parts, and high
source efficiency. (https://www.xos.com/EDXRF)

- Child of:

- a surface elemental analysis technique often used for the ultra-
trace analysis of particles, residues, and impurities on smooth
surfaces. TXRF is essentially an energy dispersive XRF technique
arranged in a special geometry. An incident beam impinges upon a
polished flat sample carrier at angles below the critical angle of
external total reflection for X-rays, resulting in the reflection of
most of the excitation beam photons at this surface. Since Total
Reflection angle depends on the energy of the photon, one can use this
effect to eliminate the high energy photons from the excitation
spectrum and minimize their contribution to the background in the
measured spectra, thus making possible to achieve better detection
limits. Due to this configuration, the measured spectral background in
TXRF is less than in conventional XRF. This reduction results in
increased signal to noise ratio. (https://www-

scattering. (Source: IUAPC; https://iupac.org/wp-

spectroscopy is commonly used in chemistry to provide a structural
fingerprint by which molecules can be identified. This technique uses
a source of monochromatic electromagnetic radiation to interact with
molecular vibrations, phonons or other excitations in the analyzed
sample resulting in the energy of the incident photons being shifted
up or down. The light source is typically a laser in the visible, near
infrared, or near ultraviolet range, although X-rays can also be used.
The shift in energy from the incident source gives information about
the vibrational modes in the analyzed sample.  Electromagnetic
radiation from the illuminated spot is collected with a lens and sent
through a monochromator. Elastic scattered radiation at the wavelength
corresponding to the incident excitation is filtered out, while the
rest of the collected light is dispersed onto a detector.

-
- Measurement method using diffraction of X-radiation to obtain the
spatial arrangement of atoms in a crystalline sample. X-ray
diffraction is based on constructive interference of monochromatic
X-rays and a crystalline sample. These X-rays are generated by a
cathode ray tube, filtered to produce monochromatic radiation,
collimated to concentrate, and directed toward the sample. The
interaction of the incident rays with the sample produces constructive
interference (and a diffracted ray) when conditions satisfy Bragg's
Law (n*'lambda'=2d*sin(theta)). This law relates the wavelength of
electromagnetic radiation to the diffraction angle and the lattice
spacing in a crystalline sample. These diffracted X-rays are then
detected, processed and counted. By changing the geometry of the
incident rays, the sample, and the detector, all possible diffraction
directions of the lattice should be attained.(https://serc.carleton.ed
u/research_education/geochemsheets/techniques/XRD.html) Copper K-a
radiation (l = 0.15406 nm, E = 8.04 keV) is typically used for routine

####  Single Crystal X-Ray Diffraction


- Child of:
 [`xraydiffraction`](#xraydiffraction)

- Single-crystal X-ray Diffraction is a non-destructive analytical
technique which provides detailed information about the internal
lattice of crystalline substances, including unit cell dimensions,
bond-lengths, bond-angles, and details of site-ordering. X-ray
diffraction is based on constructive interference of monochromatic
X-rays and a crystalline sample. These X-rays are generated by a
cathode ray tube, filtered to produce monochromatic radiation,
collimated to concentrate, and directed toward the sample. The
interaction of the incident rays with the sample produces constructive
interference (and a diffracted ray) when conditions satisfy Bragg's
Law (n*'lambda'=2d*sin(theta)). This law relates the wavelength of
electromagnetic radiation to the diffraction angle and the lattice
spacing in a crystalline sample. These diffracted X-rays are then
detected, processed and counted. By changing the geometry of the
incident rays, the orientation of the centered crystal and the
detector, all possible diffraction directions of the lattice should be
attained. Single-crystal diffractometers use either 3- or 4-circle
goniometers. These circles refer to the four angles (2*theta, 'chi',
'phi', and 'omega') that define the relationship between the crystal
lattice, the incident ray and detector. Samples are mounted on thin
glass fibers which are attached to brass pins and mounted onto
goniometer heads. Adjustment of the X, Y and Z orthogonal directions
allows centering of the crystal within the X-ray beam. Single-crystal
X-ray diffraction is most commonly used for precise determination of a
unit cell, including cell dimensions and positions of atoms within the
lattice. (https://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/geochemsheets/t

####  X-Ray Powder Diffraction


- Child of:
 [`xraydiffraction`](#xraydiffraction)

- X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) is a rapid analytical technique
primarily used for phase identification of a crystalline material and
can provide information on unit cell dimensions. The analyzed material
is finely ground, homogenized, and average bulk composition is
determined. The geometry of an X-ray diffractometer is such that the
sample rotates in the path of the collimated X-ray beam at an angle
theta while the X-ray detector is mounted on an arm to collect the
diffracted X-rays and rotates at an angle of 2*theta. The instrument
used to maintain the angle and rotate the sample is termed a
goniometer. For typical powder patterns, data is collected at 2theta
from ~5degree to 70degree, angles that are preset in the X-ray scan.
X-ray powder diffraction is most widely used for the identification of
unknown crystalline materials (e.g. minerals, inorganic compounds). (h

[]{#chromatographyseparation}

####  Chromatography separation


- Child of:
 [`analyticalseparation`](#analyticalseparation)

- a laboratory technique for the separation of a mixture into its
components. The mixture is dissolved in a fluid solvent (gas or
liquid) called the mobile phase, which carries it through a system (a
column, a capillary tube, a plate, or a sheet) on which a material
called the stationary phase is fixed. The different constituents of
the mixture travel at different apparent velocities in the mobile
fluid, causing them to separate. The separation is based on the
differential partitioning between the mobile and the stationary
phases. Chromatography separation is preparative;  purpose is to
separate the components of a mixture for later use, and is thus a form
of purification.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography)

- Breaking and/or separation of large DNA molecules into smaller
pieces (fragments). Note 1: DNA fragmentation is usually achieved via
cleavage with restriction endonucleases at specific sites or non-
specifically by, for example, sonication. Note 2: DNA fragmentation is
also a consequence of damage to DNA. (Source: IUPAC;
