# **Concept scheme:** Analytical methods for geochemistry

Vocabulary last modified:  2023-05-26

subtitle: 
  This concept scheme contains skos concepts for analysis methods used to produce observation results with information about the physical properties, chemical or isotopic composition, crystallography, or molecular structure of material samples. Based on spreadsheet compilation of method vocabularies from GeoX, GEOROC, PetDB and OSIRIS-REx. Definitions added and updated based on web research, and SKOS serialization by S.M. Richard. Note that although there are high-level method categories for 'Physical property measurements' and the 'Bioanalytical method', these are placeholders and only include a few examples that are relevant to analytical methods in geo- or cosmochemistry.

[]{#combustionanalysis}

####  Combustion analysis


- Child of:
 [`benchchemistry`](#benchchemistry)

- Technique for determination of empirical and molecular formulas for
compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen or carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen. The steps for this procedure are: 1) Weigh a sample of the
compound to be analyzed; 2) Burn the compound completely. 3)  H2O and
CO2 are drawn through two tubes. One tube contains a substance that
absorbs water, and the other contains a substance that absorbs carbon
dioxide. Weigh each of these tubes before and after the combustion.
The increase in mass in the first tube is the mass of H2O that formed
in the combustion, and the increase in mass for the second tube is the
mass of CO2 formed. Assume that all the carbon in the compound has
been converted to CO2 and trapped in the second tube. Calculate the
mass of carbon in the compound from the mass of carbon in the measured
mass of CO2 formed. Assume that all of the hydrogen in the compound
has been converted to H2O and trapped in the first tube. Calculate the
mass of hydrogen in the compound from the mass of hydrogen in the
measured mass of water. If the compound contains oxygen as well as
carbon and hydrogen, calculate the mass of the oxygen by subtracting
the mass of carbon and hydrogen from the total mass of the original
sample of compound.

- Method consists of igniting (vigorous heating) a sample at a
designated temperature which enables volatile substances within the
sample material to escape, until the mass of the sample ceases to
change. This process is often performed within air but may be done in
another inert or reactive atmosphere.  Loss on Ignition measures the
organic matter content in samples. The volatile materials lost during
the analysis typically consist of combined water (hydrates, for
example) and CO2 from carbonates. (https://www.precisa.com/blog/what-

called the stationary phase is fixed. The different constituents of
the mixture travel at different apparent velocities in the mobile
fluid, causing them to separate. The separation is based on the

isotopes of carbon (13C/12C), hydrogen (2H/1H), nitrogen (15N/14N) or
oxygen (18O/160) in individual compounds separated from often complex
mixtures of components. The sample solution is injected into the gas
chromatography (GC) inlet where it is vaporized and swept onto a
chromatographic column by the carrier gas (usually helium). The sample
flows through the column and the compounds comprising the mixture of
interest are separated by virtue of their relative interaction with
the coating of the column (stationary phase) and the carrier gas
(mobile phase). Carbon and nitrogen compounds eluting from the
chromatographic column then pass through a combustion reactor (an
alumina tube containing Cu, Ni and Pt wires maintained at 940 degree
C) where they are oxidatively combusted. This is followed by a
reduction reactor (an alumina tube containing three Cu wires
maintained at 600 degree C) to reduce any nitrogen oxides to nitrogen.
For hydrogen and oxygen a high temperature thermal conversion reactor
is required. Water is then removed in a water separator by passing the
gas stream through a tube constructed from a water permeable nafion
membrane. The sample is then introduced into the ion source of the
mass analyzer by an open split interface, and particles with m/z
ratios of interest are counted by detectors.

(mobile phase). Carbon and nitrogen compounds eluting from the
chromatographic column then pass through a combustion reactor (an
alumina tube containing Cu, Ni and Pt wires maintained at 940 degree
C) where they are oxidatively combusted. This is followed by a
reduction reactor (an alumina tube containing three Cu wires
maintained at 600 degree C) to reduce any nitrogen oxides to nitrogen.
For hydrogen and oxygen a high temperature thermal conversion reactor
is required. Water is then removed in a water separator by passing the
gas stream through a tube constructed from a water permeable nafion
membrane. The sample is then introduced into the ion source of the
mass analyzer by an open split interface, and particles with m/z
ratios of interest are counted by detectors.

additional procedures, for cleanup or exposure to acid vapor to break

the LC, which separates compounds in the solution and then passes them
into the MS, where their mass spectra are measured. Each time point on
the chromatogram is linked to a mass spectrum from which the most
intense signals are fragmented at defined CID (colision induced
dissociation) energy.  The combination of retention time (i.e., how
long it takes for the compound to pass through the LC) and mass
spectrum allows for identification of the compounds when compared to
standards.  The LC-MS-MS converted data is in a unversal format of

- a sharp probe tip mounted on a microcantilever scans over the
specimen line by line, whereby the topographic image of the sample
surface is generated by 'feeling' rather than 'looking.'
(https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-16712-6_496).  As the tip
approaches the surface, the close-range, attractive forces between the
surface and the tip causes the cantilever to deflect towards the
surface. However, as the cantilever is brought even closer to the
surface, until the tip makes contact with it, increasingly repulsive
forces takes over and causes the cantilever to deflect away from the
surface. (https://lnf-

[]{#atomprobetomography}

####  Atom probe tomography


- Child of:
 [`imagingtechniques`](#imagingtechniques)

- To conduct an atom probe experiment a very sharp needle shaped
specimen is placed in an ultra high vacuum chamber. After introduction
into the vacuum system, the sample is reduced to cryogenic
temperatures (typically 20-100 K) and manipulated such that the
needle's point is aimed towards an ion detector. A high voltage is
applied to the specimen, and either a laser pulse is applied to the
specimen or a voltage pulse (typically 1-2 kV) with pulse repetition
rates in the hundreds of kilohertz range is applied to a counter
electrode. The application of the pulse to the sample allows for
individual atoms at the sample surface to be ejected as an ion from
the sample surface at a known time. Typically the pulse amplitude and
the high voltage on the specimen are computer controlled to encourage
only one atom to ionize at a time, but multiple ionizations are
possible. The delay between application of the pulse and detection of
the ion(s) at the detector allow for the computation of a mass-to-
charge ratio. The method is destructive in nature removing ions from a
sample surface in order to image and identify them, generating
magnifications sufficient to observe individual atoms as they are
removed from the sample surface. Through coupling of this
magnification method with time of flight mass spectrometry, ions
evaporated by application of electric pulses can have their mass-to-
charge ratio computed. Through successive evaporation of material,
layers of atoms are removed from a specimen, allowing for probing not
only of the surface, but also through the material itself.The
instrument allows the three-dimensional reconstruction of up to
billions of atoms from a sharp tip (corresponding to specimen volumes
of 10,000-10,000,000 nm3). (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_probe)

[]{#cathodoluminescenceimaging}

####  Cathodoluminescence imaging


- Child of:
 [`imagingtechniques`](#imagingtechniques)

- In a vacuum chamber containing the sample of interest, an electron
beam is focused on the sample, causing cathodoluminescence (CL), the
generation of electromagnetic radiation ranging from the ultraviolet
(UV) to the near-infrared (NIR) regime of the electromagnetic
spectrum. The light is collected with a collection optic (e.g. mirror
or objective) and directed to a light detection unit, or directly
captured by a detector in the chamber. This detector output is used to
characterize various aspects of the light signal such as its
intensity, color, and more.  Many trace elements or dopants can be
sensitively detected with CL because they have different optical
transitions than the bulk materials they are embedded in. It is
possible to look at crystal defects as these can alter the local
optical properties of the material.  CL  can also image optical
resonances and guided modes in a range of (resonant) photonic and
plasmonic systems.

######  Energy-filtered transmission electron imaging


- Child of:
 [`transmissionelectronimaging`](#transmissionelectronimaging)

- The principle is to illuminate a very thin specimen with a beam of
high energy electrons. Some of these electrons will interact with the
specimen and result in elastic or inelastic scattering. Inelastic
scattering results in both a loss of energy and a change in momentum,
which in the case of inner shell ionization, the energy loss is
characteristic of the element the electron interacted with. After the
electron energy loss spectrum forms in the energy filter, an
adjustable energy slit allows only electrons that have not lost energy
to pass through to form the image. This is known as zero-loss
filtering. The filtering prevents inelastically scattered electrons
from contributing to the image plus enhances contrast image and
resolution. In addition to zero-loss filtering, you can adjust the
system to select electrons that have lost a specific amount of energy
to obtain additional contrast effects and compositionally sensitive
images. (https://eels.info/about/techniques/eftem)

multiple detectors for STEM imaging: 1) BF (bright-field) detector:
small angles (0-10 mrad). These images are similar to the bright-field

- a material is exposed to a beam of electrons with a known, narrow
range of kinetic energies. Some of the electrons will undergo
inelastic scattering, which means that they lose energy and have their
paths slightly and randomly deflected. The amount of energy loss can
be measured via an electron spectrometer and interpreted in terms of
what caused the energy loss. With some care, and looking at a wide
range of energy losses, one can determine the types of atoms, and the
numbers of atoms of each type, being struck by the beam. The
scattering angle (that is, the amount that the electron's path is
deflected) can also be measured, giving information about the
dispersion relation of whatever material excitation caused the
inelastic scattering. Most common approach today is transmission EELS,
in which the incident electrons pass entirely through the material
sample. Usually this occurs in a transmission electron microscope
(TEM), although some dedicated systems exist which enable extreme
resolution in terms of energy and momentum transfer at the expense of
spatial resolution.

#####  Transmission electron imaging


- Child of:
 [`electronmicroscopyimaging`](#electronmicroscopyimaging)

- technique in which a beam of electrons is transmitted through a
specimen to form an image. The specimen is most often an ultrathin
section less than 100 nm thick or a suspension on a grid. An image is
formed from the interaction of the electrons with the sample as the
beam is transmitted through the specimen. Multiple operating modes
based on electron imaging include conventional imaging, scanning TEM
imaging (STEM), and electron diffraction.

######  Energy-filtered transmission electron imaging


- Child of:
 [`transmissionelectronimaging`](#transmissionelectronimaging)

- The principle is to illuminate a very thin specimen with a beam of
high energy electrons. Some of these electrons will interact with the
specimen and result in elastic or inelastic scattering. Inelastic
scattering results in both a loss of energy and a change in momentum,
which in the case of inner shell ionization, the energy loss is
characteristic of the element the electron interacted with. After the
electron energy loss spectrum forms in the energy filter, an
adjustable energy slit allows only electrons that have not lost energy
to pass through to form the image. This is known as zero-loss
filtering. The filtering prevents inelastically scattered electrons
from contributing to the image plus enhances contrast image and
resolution. In addition to zero-loss filtering, you can adjust the
system to select electrons that have lost a specific amount of energy
to obtain additional contrast effects and compositionally sensitive
images. (https://eels.info/about/techniques/eftem)

######  Scanning transmission electron imaging


- Child of:
 [`transmissionelectronimaging`](#transmissionelectronimaging)

- In STEM the electron beam is focused to a fine spot (with the
typical spot size 0.05 -- 0.2 nm) which is then scanned over the
sample in a raster illumination system constructed so that the sample
is illuminated at each point with the beam parallel to the optical
axis.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy). In
TEM parallel electron beams are focused perpendicular to the sample
plane, in STEM the beam is focused at a large angle and is converged
into a focal point. The transmitted signal is collected as a function
of the beam location as it is rastered across the sample. There are
multiple detectors for STEM imaging: 1) BF (bright-field) detector:
small angles (0-10 mrad). These images are similar to the bright-field
images obtained using TEM; 2) ADF (annular dark-field ) detector:
larger angles (10-50 mrad); 3) HAADF (high-angle annular dark-field)
detector: Angles greater than 50mrad. (https://chem.libretexts.org/Cou

- Technique in which a focused beam of Me V light-mass ions is scanned
across a sample surface. The most commonly used Me V ion is the
proton, which is why the Nuclear Microprobe is also sometimes called
the Scanning Proton Microprobe. However, other MeV light ions can
generate the same analytical signals as protons, and are preferred for
some of the analytical techniques described. The focused beam is
scanned over the sample surface, and the strength of the relevant
analytical signal is measured at each position in the scanned area to
generate an image of the sample. There are many different types of
interaction that can occur when an MeV ion is incident on a sample,
and each one forms the basis of an analytical technique: Particle-
Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE), Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry
(RBS), Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA) -- nuclear reaction products
such as alpha particles, protons, neutrons, or gamma rays are emitted.
The energy of these charged reaction products is measured using a

#####  Quantitative analysis particle induced X-ray spectrometry


- Child of:
 [`particleinducedxrayspectrometry`](#particleinducedxrayspectrometry)

- Within a given sample, once the X-ray intensities of each element of
interest are "counted" in a detector at a specific beam current, the
count rates are compared to those of standards containing known values
of the elements of interest. Counting is typically done using
wavelength-dispersive spectrometry. In turn, the X-ray intensities
must be corrected for matrix effects associated with atomic number
(Z), absorption (A) and fluorescence (F). This correction procedure is
performed within a computer program that takes the raw counting rates
of each element, compares these to standards, computes the ZAF
correction (or similar type of correction) and displays the results as
a function of the weight % of the oxides or elements.

- Technique where either  the difference between heat flow rates into
a sample and a reference material is measured (heat-flow DSC) or the
difference between the electrical powers into a sample and a reference
material is measured (power compensation DSC). (Source: IUPAC;
https://doi.org/10.1515/pac-2012-0609).   A technique in which the
difference in the amount of heat required to increase the temperature
of a sample and reference is measured as a function of temperature.
Both the sample and reference are maintained at nearly the same
temperature throughout the experiment. Generally, the temperature
program for a DSC analysis is designed such that the sample holder
temperature increases linearly as a function of time. The reference
sample should have a well-defined heat capacity over the range of
temperatures to be scanned. By observing the difference in heat flow
between the sample and reference, differential scanning calorimeters
are able to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released during
phase transitions. DSC may also be used to observe more subtle
physical changes, such as glass transitions. It is widely used in
industrial settings as a quality control instrument due to its
applicability in evaluating sample purity and for studying polymer
curing.

#####  Differential thermal analysis


- Child of:
 [`thermalanalysis`](#thermalanalysis)

- Differential thermal analysis (DTA) is a technique in which the
material under study and an inert reference are made to undergo
identical thermal cycles, (i.e., same cooling or heating programme)
while recording any temperature difference between sample and
reference. This differential temperature is then plotted against time,
or against temperature (DTA curve, or thermogram). Changes in the
sample, either exothermic or endothermic, can be detected relative to
the inert reference. Thus, a DTA curve provides data on the
transformations that have occurred, such as glass transitions,
crystallization, melting and sublimation. The area under a DTA peak is
the enthalpy change and is not affected by the heat capacity of the
sample. DTA is similar to differential scanning calorimetry.

[]{#lockinthermography}

#####  Lock in thermography


- Child of:
 [`thermalanalysis`](#thermalanalysis)

- The principle of lock-in thermography is based on the application of
a periodic input energy wave (i.e. thermal emitter, ultrasound,
microwave, eddy current, flash or xenon lamp, halogen lamp, or laser)
to the surface of the object being examined and analyzing the
resulting local temperatures on the surface of the object using an
infrared camera. When the input energy wave penetrates the object's
surface, is it absorbed and phase shifted. When the input wave reaches
areas within the object where the thermophysical properties are not
homogeneous in relation to the surrounding material, (i.e. at
delaminations or inclusions), the input wave is partially reflected.
The reflected portion of the wave interferes with the incoming input
wave at the surface of the object, causing an interference pattern in
the local surface temperature, which oscillates at the same frequency
as the thermal wave. The internal structure of the object being
examined can then be derived by evaluating the phase shift of the
local surface temperatures in relation to the input energy wave. The
ability to derive internal thermophysical inconsistencies within the
object, however, requires that the input energy source be used at an
optimal frequency, which depends on both the thermophysical
characteristics of the object as well as its thickness.

<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>19</sup>F,

(Source: IUPAC; https://iupac.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PAC-
REC-19-02-03.R2_PR191002MC.pdf). A spectroscopic technique that
observes the signal produced by nuclear magnetic resonance of the
atomic nuclei in a sample when exposed to excitation by radio waves.
The signal is related to local magnetic fields around atomic nuclei.
The intramolecular magnetic field around an atom in a molecule changes
the resonance frequency, thus giving access to details of the
electronic structure of a molecule and its individual functional
groups. The electromagnetic waves emitted by the nuclei of the sample
as a result of perturbation by a weak oscillating magnetic field are
detected with sensitive radio receivers. Upon excitation of the sample
with a radio frequency (60--1000 MHz) pulse, a nuclear magnetic
resonance response - a free induction decay (FID) - is obtained. It is
a very weak signal, and requires sensitive radio receivers to pick up.
A Fourier transform is carried out to extract the frequency-domain
spectrum from the raw time-domain FID. As the fields are unique or
highly characteristic to individual compounds NMR spectroscopy is the
definitive method to identify monomolecular organic compounds.

and the effects of magnetic fields and radiofrequency pulses on

in Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) arises from the fact that emitted
electrons usually have energies ranging from 50 eV to 3 keV and at
these values, electrons have a short mean free path in a solid. The
escape depth of electrons is therefore localized to within a few
nanometers of the target surface, giving AES an extreme sensitivity to
surface species

 [`particlebeamexcitation`](#particlebeamexcitation)

- a material is exposed to a beam of electrons with a known, narrow
range of kinetic energies. Some of the electrons will undergo
inelastic scattering, which means that they lose energy and have their
paths slightly and randomly deflected. The amount of energy loss can
be measured via an electron spectrometer and interpreted in terms of
what caused the energy loss. With some care, and looking at a wide
range of energy losses, one can determine the types of atoms, and the
numbers of atoms of each type, being struck by the beam. The
scattering angle (that is, the amount that the electron's path is
deflected) can also be measured, giving information about the
dispersion relation of whatever material excitation caused the
inelastic scattering. Most common approach today is transmission EELS,
in which the incident electrons pass entirely through the material
sample. Usually this occurs in a transmission electron microscope
(TEM), although some dedicated systems exist which enable extreme
resolution in terms of energy and momentum transfer at the expense of
spatial resolution.

kinetic energy and the number of the ejected electrons. A typical XPS
spectrum is a plot of the number of electrons detected at a specific

peaks. These peaks correspond to the electron configuration of the
electrons within the atoms, e.g., 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, etc. The number of
detected electrons in each peak is directly related to the amount of
element within the XPS sampling volume. XPS requires high vacuum

components of a complex mixture. The solid sample is extracted in a
solvent to pull out soluble target compounds; this creates both a
solid residue and a liquid extract.  The extract can be subjected to
additional procedures, for cleanup or exposure to acid vapor to break
apart large molecules.  The final extracted solution is injected into
the LC, which separates compounds in the solution and then passes them
into the MS, where their mass spectra are measured. Each time point on
the chromatogram is linked to a mass spectrum from which the most
intense signals are fragmented at defined CID (colision induced
dissociation) energy.  The combination of retention time (i.e., how
long it takes for the compound to pass through the LC) and mass
spectrum allows for identification of the compounds when compared to
standards.  The LC-MS-MS converted data is in a unversal format of
data called mzML and used internationally in LC-MS-MS analytical

######  Secondary ionization mass spectrometry


- Child of:
 [`massspectrometry`](#massspectrometry)

- secondary-ion mass analyzers are based on bombarding the surface of
the sample with a beam of 5- to 20-keV ions. The ion beam is formed in
an ion gun in which the gaseous atoms or molecules are ionized by an
electron-ionization source. The positive ions are then accelerated by
applying a high dc voltage. The impact of these primary ions causes
the surface layer of atoms of the sample to be stripped (sputtered)
off, largely as neutral atoms. A small fraction, however, forms as
positive (or negative) secondary ions that are drawn into a
spectrometer for mass analysis. In secondary-ion mass analyzers, which
serve for general surface analysis and for depth profiling, the
primary ion-beam diameter ranges from 0.3 to 5 mm. Double-focusing,
single-focusing, time-of-flight, and quadrupole spectrometers are used
for mass determination. Typical transducers for SIMS are electron
multipliers, Faraday cups, and imaging detectors. (Skoog, Holler &

[]{#sparksourcemassspectrometry}

######  Spark source mass spectrometry


- Child of:
 [`massspectrometry`](#massspectrometry)

- (SSMS) a general technique for multielement and isotope trace
analyses. In SSMS, the atomic constituents of a sample, housed in a
vacuum chamber, are converted by a high-voltage (~30 kV), radio-
frequency spark to gaseous ions for mass analysis.  The gaseous
positive ions formed in the spark plasma are drawn into the analyzer
by a dc voltage. Because a spark source produces ions with a wide
range of kinetic energies, double-focusing mass spectrometers are
required for mass analysis of the ions. When electron multipliers are
used with double-focusing instruments, the spectrum is scanned by
varying the magnetic field of the magnetic analyzer. The use of this
technique leveled off and then declined with the appearance of ICPMS
and some of the other mass spectrometric methods. SSMS is still
applied to samples that are not easily dissolved and analyzed by
plasma methods.  (Skoog, Holler, & Crouch). Mass spectrometry
technique. Components: 1) sample preparation: not specified 2)
ionization: spark source. NOTE: spark source systems commonly use
double focusing mass analyzers.

######  Mossbauer spectrometry


- Child of:
 [`gammarayspectrometry`](#gammarayspectrometry)

- In its most common form a solid sample is exposed to a beam of gamma
radiation, and a detector measures the intensity of the beam
transmitted through the sample. The atoms in the source emitting the
gamma rays must be of the same isotope as the atoms in the sample
absorbing them. The source is accelerated through a range of
velocities using a linear motor to produce a Doppler effect and scan
the gamma ray energy through a given range. In the resulting spectra,
gamma ray intensity is plotted as a function of the source velocity.
At velocities corresponding to the resonant energy levels of the
sample, a fraction of the gamma rays are absorbed, resulting in a drop
in the measured intensity and a corresponding dip in the spectrum. The
number, positions, and intensities of the dips (also called peaks;
dips in transmitted intensity are peaks in absorbance) provide
information about the chemical environment of the absorbing nuclei and
can be used to characterize the sample.

######  Fourier transform infrared spectrometry


- Child of:
 [`infraredspectrometry`](#infraredspectrometry)

- A technique used to obtain an infrared spectrum of absorption or
emission of a solid, liquid, or gas. Light from a polychromatic
infrared source is collimated and directed to a beam splitter. Half
the light is directed to a fixed mirror and the rest to a moving
mirror. The light from the two paths is recombined, resulting in
constructive or destructive interference that is a function of
wavelength in the polychromatic light source and the path retardation
determined by different path lengths from the moving mirror. The
recombined light is focused on the sample and reflected or transmitted
light is refocused onto a detector.  The difference in optical path
length between the two arms to the interferometer is known as the
retardation or optical path difference (OPD). An interferogram is
obtained by varying the retardation and recording the signal from the
detector for various values of the retardation. The interferogram when
no sample is present is used as a reference to compare. When a sample
is present the background interferogram is modulated by the presence
of absorption bands in the sample. The interferogram is converted to a
spectrum by Fourier transformation.

######  Atomic absorption spectrometry


- Child of:
 [`opticalspectrometry`](#opticalspectrometry)

- Analytical technique used to measure a wide range of elements in
materials such as metals, pottery and glass, based on absorption of
light by free metallic ions. The sample is accurately weighed and then
dissolved, often using strong acids. The resulting solution is sprayed
into the flame of the instrument and atomized. Light of a suitable
wavelength for a particular element is shone through the flame, and
some of this light is absorbed by the atoms of the sample. Individual
elements will absorb wavelengths differently, and these absorbances
are measured against standards. The amount of light absorbed is
proportional to the concentration of the element in the solution, and
hence in the original object. Measurements are made separately for
each element of interest in turn to achieve a complete analysis of an
object, and thus the technique is relatively slow to use. However, it
is very sensitive and it can measure trace elements down to the part
per million level, as well as being able to measure elements present
in minor and major amounts. The method requires standards with known
analyte content to establish the relation between the measured
absorbance and the analyte concentration.

- technique for determining the composition of a sample by heating it
to the point that the material emits light, and analyzing the
wavelenth of the emitted ultraviolet to visible wavelength light.  The
sample is heated to emission temperatures using and inductively
coupled plasma. The ICP-OES is an optical emission spectrophotometric
technique that requires samples to be in solution form. The solution
gets introduced to the hot plasma, which excites the electrons that
emit energy at a given wavelength as they return to ground state. Each
element emits energy at a specific wavelength according to its
chemical character. The intensity of the energy emitted at a specific
wavelength is proportional to the concentration of that particular
sample. The elemental composition can be determined by comparing to a
set of reference standards. The final elemental composition can be
expressed as ppm or mg/L.

- Child of:
 [`electroninducedxrayspectrometry`](#electroninducedxrayspectrometry)

- X-rays are generated in the sample by interaction with the
excitation electron beam, and are selected using an analytical
crystal(s) with specific lattice spacing(s). When X-rays encounter the
analytical crystal at a specific angle theta, only those X-rays that
satisfy Bragg's Law are reflected and a single wavelength is passed on
to the detector. The wavelength of the X-rays reflected into the
detector may be varied by changing the position of the analyzing
crystal relative to the sample i.e. the X-ray source-crystal distance
is a linear function of the wavelength. Consequently, X-rays from only
one element at a time can be measured on the spectrometer and the
position of a given analytical crystal must be changed in order to
adjust to a wavelength characteristic of another element. There is
commonly more than a single analytical crystal in a WD spectrometer
and, in the case of most EPMA instruments, there are typically
multiple spectrometers with a suite of analytical crystals so that the
spectrometers can reach all of the elemental wavelengths of interest
and it will optimize performance in different wavelength ranges.
X-rays of specific wavelengths from the analytical crystal are passed
on to the X-ray detector.

######  X-ray absorption spectrometry


- Child of:
 [`xrayspectrometry`](#xrayspectrometry)

- In this technique, the sample is exposed to monochromatic X-rays for
which the photon energy is tuned to a range where core electrons can
be excited (0.1-100 keV). When the incident X-ray energy is larger
than the electron binding energy, there is a sharp increase in
absorption (an edge). The edge positions are related to the core
electron that is excited. Each element has its own edge energy, and an
element's valence can be measured even in a heterogeneous sample.
There are three main regions found on a spectrum generated by XAS data
which are treated as separate spectroscopic techniques: 1) absorption
threshold determined by the transition to the lowest unoccupied
states; 2) near-edge structure (XANES); 3) Extended X-ray absorption
fine structure (EXAFS) (at energy higher than the edge). X-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is used for determining the local
geometric and/or electronic structure of matter. The experiment is
usually performed at synchrotron radiation facilities, which provide
intense and tunable X-ray beams. Samples can be in the gas phase,
solutions, or solids.

#######  X-ray absorption near edge structure spectrometry


- Child of:
 [`xrayabsorptionspectrometry`](#xrayabsorptionspectrometry)

- This technique is based on the absorption of an X-ray photon, in
which an electron interacts with an incident X-ray to acquire a time
dependent acceleration. The electron may then be promoted from a core-
orbital to an unoccupied bound or continuum state with an intensity
given by Fermi's Golden Rule. By varying the energy of a
monochromatized beam of incident photons, a spectrum of the absorption
cross section can be generated. The probability of an excitation
sharply increases when the energy of the incident photon reaches the
binding energy of a core-electron. In X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
(XAS) this is referred to as an edge. XANES is a subset of XAS in
which the local electronic structure is characterized by investigating
the absorption cross section within 50-100 eV of an edge. The XANES
region is sensitive to a wealth of electronic structure information,
which may be analyzed in three sections. Before the edge, the
intensity of pre-edge features is greatly affected by the coordination
geometry of the central atom. At the edge, formal oxidation state may
be qualitatively assigned, as the energy of the edge position is not
an invariant quantity for a given element, the position shifts in
accordance with electron density. Finally, coordination shells are
interrogated just beyond the edge as the emitted photoelectron
scatters off neighboring atoms.

- The confocal geometry uses two polycapillary focusing optics for
enhanced applications of XRF elemental analysis. An excitation optic
focuses a small X-ray beam onto the specimen. A detection optic
collects fluorescent X-rays from the sample. Specifically, elemental
concentrations are measured within the small probe volume ('confocal
volume') defined by the intersection of the output focal spot of the
excitation optic and the input focal spot of the collection optic.
The polycapillary focusing optics act as spatial filters to eliminate
background radiation from the sample and increase detection
sensitivity for sample elements of interest. Additionally, confocal
XRF can be used for elemental depth profiling. Confocal XRF acts as a
material probe by exciting and detecting emitted characteristic X-ray
photons from within the confocal analysis volume as this volume is
through the sample. In this way elemental concentrations can be
measured on the object's surface and throughout the object's interior.

- a surface elemental analysis technique often used for the ultra-

surfaces. TXRF is essentially an energy dispersive XRF technique
arranged in a special geometry. An incident beam impinges upon a
polished flat sample carrier at angles below the critical angle of
external total reflection for X-rays, resulting in the reflection of
most of the excitation beam photons at this surface. Since Total
Reflection angle depends on the energy of the photon, one can use this
effect to eliminate the high energy photons from the excitation
spectrum and minimize their contribution to the background in the
measured spectra, thus making possible to achieve better detection
limits. Due to this configuration, the measured spectral background in
TXRF is less than in conventional XRF. This reduction results in
increased signal to noise ratio. (https://www-

spectroscopy is commonly used in chemistry to provide a structural
fingerprint by which molecules can be identified. This technique uses
a source of monochromatic electromagnetic radiation to interact with
molecular vibrations, phonons or other excitations in the analyzed
sample resulting in the energy of the incident photons being shifted
up or down. The light source is typically a laser in the visible, near
infrared, or near ultraviolet range, although X-rays can also be used.
The shift in energy from the incident source gives information about
the vibrational modes in the analyzed sample.  Electromagnetic
radiation from the illuminated spot is collected with a lens and sent
through a monochromator. Elastic scattered radiation at the wavelength
corresponding to the incident excitation is filtered out, while the

(https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-16712-6_496).  As the tip
approaches the surface, the close-range, attractive forces between the
surface and the tip causes the cantilever to deflect towards the
surface. However, as the cantilever is brought even closer to the
surface, until the tip makes contact with it, increasingly repulsive
forces takes over and causes the cantilever to deflect away from the
surface. (https://lnf-

- carried out by placing a catalyst inside a reactor and pushing an
inert gas into the chamber. Alternatively the sample can be located in
a UHV chamber with no carrier gas. The sample is dosed with a probe
gas such as CO, NH3, H2 etc. The sample is then increased in
temperature at a linear ramp rate and the desorption products analysed
by a mass spectrometer. This technique is powerful and effective in
obtaining information about surface chemistry.

- Like fission-track dating, alpha-recoil track (ART) dating is based
on the accumulation of nuclear particles that are released by natural
radioactivity and produce etchable tracks in solids. ARTs are formed
during the alpha-decay of uranium and thorium as well as of their
daughter nuclei. When emitting an alpha-particle, the heavy remaining
nucleus recoils 30-40 nm, leaving behind a trail of radiation damage.
Through etching the ART tracks become visible with interference phase-
contrast microscopy. Alpha-recoil dating has a great potential for
Quaternary chronometry and tephrochronology.

[]{#xraydiffraction}

###  X-ray diffraction


- Child of:
 [`analyticalmethod`](#analyticalmethod)

- Measurement method using diffraction of X-radiation to obtain the
spatial arrangement of atoms in a crystalline sample. X-ray
diffraction is based on constructive interference of monochromatic
X-rays and a crystalline sample. These X-rays are generated by a
cathode ray tube, filtered to produce monochromatic radiation,
collimated to concentrate, and directed toward the sample. The
interaction of the incident rays with the sample produces constructive
interference (and a diffracted ray) when conditions satisfy Bragg's
Law (n*'lambda'=2d*sin(theta)). This law relates the wavelength of
electromagnetic radiation to the diffraction angle and the lattice
spacing in a crystalline sample. These diffracted X-rays are then
detected, processed and counted. By changing the geometry of the
incident rays, the sample, and the detector, all possible diffraction
directions of the lattice should be attained.(https://serc.carleton.ed
u/research_education/geochemsheets/techniques/XRD.html) Copper K-a
radiation (l = 0.15406 nm, E = 8.04 keV) is typically used for routine
XRD. (Source: IUPAC; https://doi.org/10.1515/pac-2019-0302). Technique
based on observing the scattered intensity of an X-ray beam hitting a
sample as a function of incident and scattered angle, polarization,
and wavelength or energy where the scattering is elastic and the
scattering object is crystalline, so that the resulting pattern
contains sharp spots analyzed by X-ray crystallography.

[]{#singlecrystalxraydiffraction}

####  Single crystal X-ray diffraction


- Child of:
 [`xraydiffraction`](#xraydiffraction)

- Single-crystal X-ray Diffraction is a non-destructive analytical
technique which provides detailed information about the internal
lattice of crystalline substances, including unit cell dimensions,
bond-lengths, bond-angles, and details of site-ordering. X-ray
diffraction is based on constructive interference of monochromatic
X-rays and a crystalline sample. These X-rays are generated by a
cathode ray tube, filtered to produce monochromatic radiation,
collimated to concentrate, and directed toward the sample. The
interaction of the incident rays with the sample produces constructive
interference (and a diffracted ray) when conditions satisfy Bragg's
Law (n*'lambda'=2d*sin(theta)). This law relates the wavelength of
electromagnetic radiation to the diffraction angle and the lattice
spacing in a crystalline sample. These diffracted X-rays are then
detected, processed and counted. By changing the geometry of the
incident rays, the orientation of the centered crystal and the
detector, all possible diffraction directions of the lattice should be
attained. Single-crystal diffractometers use either 3- or 4-circle
goniometers. These circles refer to the four angles (2*theta, 'chi',
'phi', and 'omega') that define the relationship between the crystal
lattice, the incident ray and detector. Samples are mounted on thin
glass fibers which are attached to brass pins and mounted onto
goniometer heads. Adjustment of the X, Y and Z orthogonal directions
allows centering of the crystal within the X-ray beam. Single-crystal
X-ray diffraction is most commonly used for precise determination of a
unit cell, including cell dimensions and positions of atoms within the
lattice. (https://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/geochemsheets/t

[]{#xraypowderdiffraction}

####  X-ray powder diffraction


- Child of:
 [`xraydiffraction`](#xraydiffraction)

- X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) is a rapid analytical technique
primarily used for phase identification of a crystalline material and
can provide information on unit cell dimensions. The analyzed material
is finely ground, homogenized, and average bulk composition is
determined. The geometry of an X-ray diffractometer is such that the
sample rotates in the path of the collimated X-ray beam at an angle
theta while the X-ray detector is mounted on an arm to collect the
diffracted X-rays and rotates at an angle of 2*theta. The instrument
used to maintain the angle and rotate the sample is termed a
goniometer. For typical powder patterns, data is collected at 2theta
from ~5degree to 70degree, angles that are preset in the X-ray scan.
X-ray powder diffraction is most widely used for the identification of
unknown crystalline materials (e.g. minerals, inorganic compounds). (h
